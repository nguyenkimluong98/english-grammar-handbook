<b>A - An</b><br /><br/><b>CASE 1</b><br /><br />The article A is used before singular, countable nouns which begin with consonant sounds.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He is a teacher.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She doesn't own a car.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I saw a bear at the zoo.</font><br /><br /><b>CASE 2</b><br /><br />The article AN is used before singular, countable nouns which begin with vowel sounds.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He is an actor.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She didn't get an invitation.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I saw an eagle at the zoo.</font><br /><br /><b>CASE 3</b><br /><br />Remember that A(AN) means "one" or "a single". You cannot use A(AN) with plural nouns.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I saw a bears in Yellowstone National Park. <font color='Red'><b>Wrong</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I saw bears in Yellowstone National Park. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br /><b>CASE 4</b><br /><br />If there is an adjective or an adverb-adjective combination before the noun, A(AN) should agree with the first sound in the adjective or the adverb-adjective combination.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He is an excellent teacher.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I saw a really beautiful eagle at the zoo.</font><br /><br /><b>CASE 5</b><br /><br />Use A before words such as "European" or "university" which sound like they start with a consonant even if the first letter is a vowel. Also use A before letters and numbers which sound like they begin with a consonant, such as "U", "J", "1" or "9". Remember, it is the sound not the spelling which is important. For example, "1" is spelled O-N-E; however, it is pronounced "won" like it starts with a "W".<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She has a euro. Sounds like "yu-ro".</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    That number is a "1". Sounds like "won".</font><br /><br /><b>CASE 6</b><br /><br />Use AN before words such as "hour" which sound like they start with a vowel even if the first letter is a consonant. Also use AN before letters and numbers which sound like they begin with a vowel, such as "F" or "8". Remember, it is the sound not the spelling which is important. For example, "F" is pronounced "eff" like it starts with an "E".<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I only have an hour for lunch. Sounds like "au-er".</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Does his name begin with an "F"? Sounds like "eff".</font><br /><br /><b>CASE 7</b><br /><br />Some words such as "herb" or "hospital" are more complicated because they are pronounced differently in different English accents. In most American accents, the "h" in "herb" is silent, so Americans usually say "an herb". In many British accents, the "h" in "herb" is pronounced, so many British say "a herb". In some British accents, the "h" in hospital is silent, so some British will say "an hospital" instead of "a hospital".<br /><br /><b>CASE 8</b><br /><br />In English, some nouns are considered uncountable such as: information, air, advice, salt and fun. We do not use A(AN) with these uncountable nouns.
