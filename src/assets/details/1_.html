<p><b>A</b> and <b>an</b> are the indefinite articles. They refer to something not specifically
known to the person you are communicating with.</p>
<p><b>A</b> and <b>an</b> are used before nouns that introduce something or someone you
have not mentioned before:-</p>
<p><i>For example</i></p>
<p>&quot;I saw <i><b>an</b></i> elephant this morning.&quot; <br/>
&quot;I ate <i><b>a</b></i> banana for
lunch.&quot;</p>
<p><b>A</b> and <b>an</b> are also used when talking about your profession:-</p>
<p><i>For example</i></p>
<p>&quot;I am <b><i>an</i></b> English teacher.&quot; <br/>
&quot;I am <i><b>a </b></i>student.&quot;</p>
<p>You use <b><i>a</i></b> when the noun you are referring to begins
with a consonant (b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t,
v, w, x, y or z), for example, &quot;<b>a</b> city&quot;, &quot;<b>a</b> factory&quot;, and &quot;a hotel&quot;. </p>
<p>You use <b><i>an</i></b> when the
noun you are referring to begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u)</p>
<p>Pronunciation changes this rule. It's the sound that matters, not the spelling. <br/>
<br/>
<span class="btn-info">Note!</span> If the next word begins with a <i>consonant</i> <i>sound</i> when
we say it, for example, &quot;university&quot;
then we use <b>a</b>. If the next word
begins with a <i>vowel sound </i>when we say it, for example &quot;hour&quot;
then we use <b>an</b>.</p>
<p>We say &quot;university&quot; with a &quot;y&quot; sound at the
beginning as though it were spelt &quot;<i>you</i>niversity&quot;.<br/>
So, &quot;<b>a</b> university&quot;
IS correct.</p>
<p>We say &quot;hour&quot; with a silent h as though it were spelt
&quot;our&quot;.<br/>
So, &quot;<b>an</b> hour&quot; IS correct.</p>
<p>(Lots of people get this wrong - including native speakers.) </p>
