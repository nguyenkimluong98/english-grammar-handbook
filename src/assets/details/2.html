<b>A(An) vs. The</b><br /><b>USE 9</b><br /><br />A and AN are called indefinite articles. "Indefinite" means "not specific". Use A(AN) when you are talking about a thing in general, NOT a specific thing.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I need a phone. Not a specific phone, any phone</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Mark wants a bicycle. Not a particular bicycle, a bicycle in general</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Do you have a driver's license? In general</font><br /><br />Use A(AN) when talking about a thing which is new, unknown, or introduced to a listener for the first time. Also use A(AN) when you are asking about the existence of something.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I have a car. The car is being introduced for the first time.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Tom is a teacher. This is new information to the listener.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Is there a dictionary in your backpack? Asking about the existence of the dictionary</font><br /><br />Similarly, use A(AN) to introduce what type of thing we are talking about.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    That is an excellent book. Describing the kind of book</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Do you live in a big house? Asking about the kind of house</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I ate a thick, juicy steak. Describing the kind of steak</font><br /><br />REMEMBER: You cannot use A(AN) with plural nouns because A(AN) means "one" or "a single".<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I saw a bears in Yellowstone National Park. <font color='Red'><b>Not Correct</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I saw bears in Yellowstone National Park. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br /><b>USE 10</b><br /><br />THE is called a definite article. "Definite" means "specific". Use THE when talking about something which is already known to the listener or which has been previously mentioned, introduced, or discussed.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I have a cat. The cat is black.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    There is a book in my backpack. The book is very heavy.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Do you know where I left the car keys? The listener knows which specific car keys you are talking about.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Do you own a car? Is the car blue? You assume they do have a car after asking about it in the first sentence.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Nobody lives on the Moon. The Moon is known to everyone.</font><br /><br />IMPORTANT: You can use THE with both singular nouns and plural nouns.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I saw the bear in Yellowstone National Park. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I saw the bears in Yellowstone National Park. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br /><b>USE 11</b><br /><br />Many clauses and phrases make the noun known to the listener by telling the listener which person or thing we are talking about. Let's look at an example sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>Can you give me the book on the table.</font><br /><br />We use THE in this sentence because the phrase "on the table" tells the listener which book we are referring to. We are not talking about other books, we are talking about a specific book that the listener can see or already knows about. Learning to recognize such identifying clauses and phrases will help you use THE correctly.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Did you read the book which I gave you?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He didn't like the movie that you suggested.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He loved the dessert with chocolate and cherries.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The phone on my desk belongs to Ken.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Did you know the man who was talking to Leonie?</font><br /><br />HOWEVER: Not all clauses and phrases make the noun known to the listener. Some are simply descriptive. They add extra information, but they do not tell the listener which specific thing we are talking about.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He bought the house with a big backyard. This combination tells the listener which specific house he bought.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He bought a house with a big backyard. This combination tells the listener what kind of house he bought, but not the specific house he bought.</font><br /><br /><br /><b>Advanced Article Usage</b><br /><b>USE 12</b><br /><br />A(AN) can be used like the word "per".<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Apples currently cost $1.30 a pound.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Cheetahs can run 60 miles an hour.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You want $150 a person for the tour?</font><br /><br /><b>USE 13</b><br /><br />Use THE with nouns modified by ranking or ordering expressions such as "the first", "the second", "the third", "the next", "the last", "the previous", "the following", "the penultimate", etc.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    This is the fifth day of our conference.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I'll pay the next time we have dinner.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Don't forget the following rule.</font><br /><br /><b>USE 14</b><br /><br />Use THE with superlatives such as "the best", "the biggest", "the most important", "the least interesting", etc.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    This is the best day ever.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    That is the most expensive hotel room I've ever heard of in my life.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He told the funniest joke!</font><br /><br />Comparative forms, such as "bigger", "better", "more" can be used with both A(AN) and THE and follow general article usage.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I like the bigger roller coaster.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He has a more expensive car than I do.</font><br /><br />HOWEVER: THE is often used with comparative forms (bigger) rather than superlative forms (biggest) when comparing only two things. This is commonly used in phrases such as "the bigger of the two".<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Jessie and Shauna are both smart. But I think Shauna is the smarter of the two.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Between Jason's son and his daughter, his daughter is the better athlete.</font><br /><br /><b>USE 15</b><br /><br />Do not use articles when generalizing about uncountable nouns and plural countable nouns.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Curiosity is a great trait. Uncountable</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Water is an important resource. Uncountable</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Vegetables are good for you. Plural countable</font><br /><br /><b>USE 16</b><br /><br />English speakers often use THE plus a singular noun when they talk about or make generalizations about certain topics, including:<br /><br />    musical instruments (the piano, the guitar, the flute)<br />    plants (the coconut palm, the saguaro, the baobab)<br />    animals (the leopard, the elephant, the lowland gorilla)<br />    inventions (the steam engine, the plane, the light bulb)<br />    currencies (the dollar, the euro, the yen)<br />    body parts (the head, the eye, the ear)<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I play the piano.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The sequoia tree is native to California.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The dolphin is a very intelligent animal.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The Wright brothers invented the airplane.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Right now, the euro is stronger than the dollar.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Cheryl got poked in the eye.</font><br /><br />In general, English speakers choose to use THE in this way to give the noun a more abstract or conceptual sound. We choose to say "the piano" to make it sound more like an abstract art form. Similarly, "the dolphin" sounds more like we are referring to the species. Moreover, "the plane" has a more conceptual sound that conveys the idea of invention. But remember, you can also make generalizations about these topics using plurals as in USE 15.<br /><b>USE 17</b><br /><br />The expressions "a few" and "a little" mean "some" and express the idea that you have more than expected.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He always carries a few dollars for emergencies.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He had a little difficulty with his homework.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She has a few friends who can help her move.</font><br /><br />HOWEVER: The expressions "few" and "little" (without an article) mean "not much" and express the idea that you have less than expected.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Unfortunately, I had little time to enjoy New York because I had to work so much.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Sadly, he has few people in his life.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    They have little money, so their daughter cannot pay her tuition.</font><br /><br />BUT REMEMBER: When the words "only" or "just" are used, "a few" and "a little" also emphasize the meaning "not much".<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Unfortunately, I only had a little time to enjoy New York because I had to work so much.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Sadly, he just has a few people in his life.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    They only have a little money, so their daughter cannot pay her tuition.</font><br /><br /><b>USE 18</b><br /><br />Generally, articles are not used with the names of illnesses or diseases.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Dr. Smith visits schools and universities to educate students on AIDS.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Oncologists are doctors who specialize in treating cancer.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    There are several medications that can be used to treat malaria.</font><br /><br />HOWEVER: There are some illnesses which require THE.<br /><br />    the measles<br />    the flu<br />    the mumps<br />    the bubonic plague<br /><br />MOREOVER: There are a few health conditions or illnesses which can be used with both A(AN) as well as THE and follow general article use.
