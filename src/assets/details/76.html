<b>Must</b><br /><br />"Must" is most commonly used to express certainty. It can also be used to express necessity or strong recommendation, although native speakers prefer the more flexible form "have to." "Must not" can be used to prohibit actions, but this sounds very severe; speakers prefer to use softer modal verbs such as "should not" or "ought not" to dissuade rather than prohibit.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    This must be the right address! certainty</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Students must pass an entrance examination to study at this school. necessity</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You must take some medicine for that cough. strong recommendation</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Jenny, you must not play in the street! prohibition</font><br /><br /><b>Using "Must" in Present, Past, and Future</b><br /><br />Most modal verbs behave quite irregularly in the past and the future.
