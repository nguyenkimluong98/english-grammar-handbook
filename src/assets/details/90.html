<b>Past Perfect</b><br /><br />
The past perfect refers to a time earlier than before now. It is used to make it clear that one event happened before another in the past. It does not matter which event is mentioned first - the tense makes it clear which one happened first.<br />
The Past Perfect tense in English is composed of two parts: the past tense of the verb to have (had) + the past participle of the main verb.

Completed Action Before Something in the Past</b><br /><br />The Past Perfect expresses the idea that something occurred before another action in the past. It can also show that something happened before a specific time in the past.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I had never seen such a beautiful beach before I went to Kauai.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I did not have any money because I had lost my wallet.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Tony knew Istanbul so well because he had visited the city several times.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Had Susan ever studied Thai before she moved to Thailand?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She only understood the movie because she had read the book.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Kristine had never been to an opera before last night.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    We were not able to get a hotel room because we had not booked in advance.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    A: Had you ever visited the U.S. before your trip in 2006?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    B: Yes, I had been to the U.S. once before.</font><br /><br /><b>2. Duration Before Something in the Past (Non-Continuous Verbs)</b><br /><br />With Non-Continuous Verbs and some non-continuous uses of Mixed Verbs, we use the Past Perfect to show that something started in the past and continued up until another action in the past.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    We had had that car for ten years before it broke down.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    By the time Alex finished his studies, he had been in London for over eight years.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    They felt bad about selling the house because they had owned it for more than forty years.</font><br /><br />Although the above use of Past Perfect is normally limited to Non-Continuous Verbs and non-continuous uses of Mixed Verbs, the words "live," "work," "teach," and "study" are sometimes used in this way even though they are NOT Non-Continuous Verbs.<br /><br /><b>3. Specific Times with the Past Perfect</b><br /><br />Unlike with the Present Perfect, it is possible to use specific time words or phrases with the Past Perfect. Although this is possible, it is usually not necessary.<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She had visited her Japanese relatives once in 1993 before she moved in with them in 1996.</font><br /><br /><b>4. Moreover</b><br /><br />If the Past Perfect action did occur at a specific time, the Simple Past can be used instead of the Past Perfect when "before" or "after" is used in the sentence. The words "before" and "after" actually tell you what happens first, so the Past Perfect is optional. For this reason, both sentences below are correct.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She had visited her Japanese relatives once in 1993 before she moved in with them in 1996.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She visited her Japanese relatives once in 1993 before she moved in with them in 1996.</font><br /><br /><b>5. However</b><br /><br />If the Past Perfect is not referring to an action at a specific time, Past Perfect is not optional. Compare the examples below. Here Past Perfect is referring to a lack of experience rather than an action at a specific time. For this reason, Simple Past cannot be used.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She never saw a bear before she moved to Alaska. <font color='Red'><b>Not Correct</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She had never seen a bear before she moved to Alaska. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br /><b>6. Position of Adverbs</b><br /><br />The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You had previously studied English before you moved to New York.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Had you previously studied English before you moved to New York?</font><br /><br /><b>7. Active / Passive</b><br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    George had repaired many cars before he received his mechanic's license. <font color='Black'><i>ACTIVE</i></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Many cars had been repaired by George before he received his mechanic's license. <font color='Black'><i>PASSIVE</i></font></font><br /><br />
