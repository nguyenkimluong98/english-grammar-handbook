<b>Present Continuous</b><br /><br />
As with all tenses in English, the speaker's attitude is as important as the time of the action or event. When someone uses the present continuous, they are thinking about something that is unfinished or incomplete.<br />
The present continuous of any verb is composed of two parts - the present tense of the verb to be + the present participle of the main verb.
(The form of the present participle is: base+ing, e.g. talking, playing, moving, smiling)

Now</b><br /><br />Use the Present Continuous with Normal Verbs to express the idea that something is happening now, at this very moment. It can also be used to show that something is not happening now.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You are learning English now.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You are not swimming now.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Are you sleeping?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I am sitting.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I am not standing.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Is he sitting or standing?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    They are reading their books.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    They are not watching television.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    What are you doing?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Why aren't you doing your homework?</font><br /><br /><b>2. Longer Actions in Progress Now</b><br /><br />In English, "now" can mean: this second, today, this month, this year, this century, and so on. Sometimes, we use the Present Continuous to say that we are in the process of doing a longer action which is in progress; however, we might not be doing it at this exact second.<br /><br />Examples: (All of these sentences can be said while eating dinner in a restaurant.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I am studying to become a doctor.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I am not studying to become a dentist.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I am reading the book Tom Sawyer.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I am not reading any books right now.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Are you working on any special projects at work?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Aren't you teaching at the university now?</font><br /><br /><b>3. Near Future</b><br /><br />Sometimes, speakers use the Present Continuous to indicate that something will or will not happen in the near future.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I am meeting some friends after work.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I am not going to the party tonight.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Is he visiting his parents next weekend?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Isn't he coming with us tonight?</font><br /><br /><b>4. Repetition and Irritation with "Always"</b><br /><br />The Present Continuous with words such as "always" or "constantly" expresses the idea that something irritating or shocking often happens. Notice that the meaning is like Simple Present, but with negative emotion. Remember to put the words "always" or "constantly" between "be" and "verb+ing."<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She is always coming to class late.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He is constantly talking. I wish he would shut up.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I don't like them because they are always complaining.</font><br /><br /><b>5. Non-Continuous Verbs/ Mixed Verbs</b><br /><br />It is important to remember that Non-Continuous Verbs cannot be used in any continuous tenses. Also, certain non-continuous meanings for Mixed Verbs cannot be used in continuous tenses. Instead of using Present Continuous with these verbs, you must use Simple Present.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She is loving this chocolate ice cream. <font color='Red'><b>Not Correct</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She loves this chocolate ice cream. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br /><b>6.
