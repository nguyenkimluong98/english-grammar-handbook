<b>Simple Past</b><br /><br />
The simple past is used to talk about a completed action in a time before now. Duration is not important. The time of the action can be in the recent past or the distant past.

&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You did not call Tom.</font><br /><br /><b>1. Completed Action in the Past</b><br /><br />Use the Simple Past to express the idea that an action started and finished at a specific time in the past. Sometimes, the speaker may not actually mention the specific time, but they do have one specific time in mind.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I saw a movie yesterday.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I didn't see a play yesterday.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Last year, I traveled to Japan.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Last year, I didn't travel to Korea.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Did you have dinner last night?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She washed her car.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He didn't wash his car.</font><br /><br /><b>2. A Series of Completed Actions</b><br /><br />We use the Simple Past to list a series of completed actions in the past. These actions happen 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and so on.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I finished work, walked to the beach, and found a nice place to swim.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He arrived from the airport at 8:00, checked into the hotel at 9:00, and met the others at 10:00.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Did you add flour, pour in the milk, and then add the eggs?</font><br /><br /><b>3. Duration in Past</b><br /><br />The Simple Past can be used with a duration which starts and stops in the past. A duration is a longer action often indicated by expressions such as: for two years, for five minutes, all day, all year, etc.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I lived in Brazil for two years.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Shauna studied Japanese for five years.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    They sat at the beach all day.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    They did not stay at the party the entire time.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    We talked on the phone for thirty minutes.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    A: How long did you wait for them?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    B: We waited for one hour.</font><br /><br /><b>4. Habits in the Past</b><br /><br />The Simple Past can also be used to describe a habit which stopped in the past. It can have the same meaning as "used to." To make it clear that we are talking about a habit, we often add expressions such as: always, often, usually, never, when I was a child, when I was younger, etc.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I studied French when I was a child.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He played the violin.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He didn't play the piano.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Did you play a musical instrument when you were a kid?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She worked at the movie theater after school.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    They never went to school, they always skipped class.</font><br /><br /><b>5. Past Facts or Generalizations</b><br /><br />The Simple Past can also be used to describe past facts or generalizations which are no longer true. As in USE 4 above, this use of the Simple Past is quite similar to the expression "used to."<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She was shy as a child, but now she is very outgoing.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He didn't like tomatoes before.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Did you live in Texas when you were a kid?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    People paid much more to make cell phone calls in the past.</font><br /><br /><b>6. When-Clauses Happen First</b><br /><br />Clauses are groups of words which have meaning but are often not complete sentences. Some clauses begin with the word "when" such as "when I dropped my pen..." or "when class began..." These clauses are called when-clauses, and they are very important. The examples below contain when-clauses.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    When I paid her one dollar, she answered my question.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She answered my question when I paid her one dollar.</font><br /><br />When-clauses are important because they always happen first when both clauses are in the Simple Past. Both of the examples above mean the same thing: first, I paid her one dollar, and then, she answered my question. It is not important whether "when I paid her one dollar" is at the beginning of the sentence or at the end of the sentence. However, the example below has a different meaning. First, she answered my question, and then, I paid her one dollar.<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I paid her one dollar when she answered my question.</font><br /><br /><b>7. Position of Adverbs</b><br /><br />The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You just called Debbie.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Did you just call Debbie?</font><br /><br /><b>8. Active / Passive</b><br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Tom repaired the car. <font color='Black'><i>ACTIVE</i></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The car was repaired by Tom. <font color='Black'><i>PASSIVE</i></font></font><br />
