<b>Present Conditionals</b><br><br /><b>Present Real Conditional</b><br /><b>FORM</b><br /><br />[If / When ... Simple Present ..., ... Simple Present ...]<br /><br />[... Simple Present ... if / when ... Simple Present ...]<br /><b>USE</b><br /><br />The Present Real Conditional is used to talk about what you normally do in real-life situations.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I go to a friend's house for dinner, I usually take a bottle of wine or some flowers.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    When I have a day off from work, I often go to the beach.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If the weather is nice, she walks to work.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Jerry helps me with my homework when he has time.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I read if there is nothing on TV.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    A: What do you do when it rains?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    B: I stay at home.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    A: Where do you stay if you go to Sydney?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    B: I stay with my friends near the harbor.</font><br /><br /><b>IMPORTANT If / When</b><br /><br />Both "if" and "when" are used in the Present Real Conditional. Using "if" suggests that something happens less frequently. Using "when" suggests that something happens regularly.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    When I have a day off from work, I usually go to the beach.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I regularly have days off from work.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I have a day off from work, I usually go to the beach.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I rarely have days off from work.</font><br /><br /><b>Present Unreal Conditional</b><br /><b>FORM</b><br /><br />[If ... Simple Past ..., ... would + verb ...]<br /><br />[... would + verb ... if ... Simple Past ...]<br /><b>USE</b><br /><br />The Present Unreal Conditional is used to talk about what you would generally do in imaginary situations.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I owned a car, I would drive to work. But I don't own a car.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She would travel around the world if she had more money. But she doesn't have much money.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I would read more if I didn't watch so much TV.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Mary would move to Japan if she spoke Japanese.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If they worked harder, they would earn more money.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    A: What would you do if you won the lottery?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    B: I would buy a house.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    A: Where would you live if you moved to the U.S.?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    B: I would live in Seattle.</font><br /><br /><b>EXCEPTION If I were ...</b><br /><br />In the Present Unreal Conditional, the form "was" is not considered grammatically correct. In written English or in testing situations, you should always use "were." However, in everyday conversation, "was" is often used.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If he were French, he would live in Paris.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If she were rich, she would buy a yacht.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I would play basketball if I were taller.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I would buy that computer if it were cheaper.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I would buy that computer if it was cheaper. <font color='Red'><b>Not Correct</b></font> (But often said in conversation.)</font><br /><br /><b>IMPORTANT Only use "If"</b><br />Only the word "if" is used with the Present Unreal Conditional because you are discussing imaginary situations. "When" cannot be used.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I would buy that computer when it were cheaper. <font color='Red'><b>Not Correct</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I would buy that computer if it were cheaper. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br /><b>EXCEPTION Conditional with Modal Verbs</b><br /><br />There are some special conditional forms for modal verbs in English:<br /><br />would + can = could<br /><br />would + shall = should<br /><br />would + may = might<br /><br />The words "can," "shall" and "may" cannot be used with "would." Instead, they must be used in these special forms.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I went to Egypt, I would can learn Arabic. <font color='Red'><b>Not Correct</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I went to Egypt, I could learn Arabic. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If she had time, she would may go to the party. <font color='Red'><b>Not Correct</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If she had time, she might go to the party. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br />The words "could," should," "might" and "ought to" include conditional, so you cannot combine them with "would."<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I had more time, I would could exercise after work. <font color='Red'><b>Not Correct</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I had more time, I could exercise after work. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If he invited you, you really would should go. <font color='Red'><b>Not Correct</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If he invited you, you really should go. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br />
