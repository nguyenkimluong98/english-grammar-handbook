<b>Countable & Uncountable Nouns</b><br /><br /><b>1. Countable Nouns</b><br /><br />Countable nouns are for things we can count using numbers. They have a singular and a plural form. The singular form can use the determiner "a" or "an". If you want to ask about the quantity of a countable noun, you ask "How many?" combined with the plural countable noun.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />

&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Jessie has ten dollars.</font><br /><br /><b>2. Uncountable Nouns</b><br /><br />Uncountable nouns are for the things that we cannot count with numbers. They may be the names for abstract ideas or qualities or for physical objects that are too small or too amorphous to be counted (liquids, powders, gases, etc.). Uncountable nouns are used with a singular verb. They usually do not have a plural form.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />

Uncountable Plurals</b><br /><br />Sometimes in English, we do use uncountable nouns in plural forms. This is most commonly done with liquids and substances. It usually takes on the meaning of "cups of", "bottles of" or "types of".<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    We'll have two coffees. Cups of coffee</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I bought three waters. Bottles of water</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The company produces two leathers. Types of leather</font><br /><br /><b>4. Different Meanings</b><br /><br />There are certain words which have multiple meanings. It is possible for one meaning to be countable and the other to be uncountable. Take for example the word "light":<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I couldn't see anything because there was no light. Uncountable noun</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The Christmas tree was covered with hundreds of lights. Countable noun</font><br /><br />Generally, the rules are still the same. The first use of "light" is a form of energy. The second use of "light" means "small light bulbs", which are normal countable objects.<br />
