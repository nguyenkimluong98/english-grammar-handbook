<b>Prefixes and suffixes</b>
<br /><br />
Prefixes and suffixes are sets of letters that are added to the beginning or end of another word. They are not words in their own right and cannot stand on their own in a sentence: if they are printed on their own they have a hyphen before or after them.
<br /><br />
<b>Prefixes</b>
<br /><br />
Prefixes are added to the beginning of an existing word in order to create a new word with a different meaning. For example:<br /><br />
word 	prefix 	new word
<br />
happy	un- 	unhappy<br />
cultural 	multi- 	multicultural<br />
work 	over- 	overwork<br />
space 	cyber- 	cyberspace<br />
market 	super- 	supermarket<br />
<br />
<b>Suffixes</b>
<br />
Suffixes are added to the end of an existing word. For example:<br /><br />
word 	suffix 	new word<br />
child 	-ish 	childish<br />
work 	-er 	worker<br />
taste 	-less 	tasteless<br />
idol 	-ize/-ise 	idolize/idolise<br />
like 	-able 	likeable<br />
<br /><br />
The addition of a suffix often changes a word from one word class to another. In the table above, the verb like becomes the adjective likeable, the noun idol becomes the verb idolize, and the noun child becomes the adjective childish.
Word creation with prefixes and suffixes
<br /><br />
Some prefixes and suffixes are part of our living language, in that people regularly use them to create new words for modern products, concepts, or situations. For example:<br /><br />
word 	prefix or suffix 	new word<br />
security 	bio- 	biosecurity<br />
clutter 	de- 	declutter<br />
media 	multi- 	multimedia<br />
email 	-er 	emailer<br />
<br /><br />
Email is an example of a word that was itself formed from a new prefix, e-, which stands for electronic. This modern prefix has formed an ever-growing number of other Internet-related words, including e-book, e-cash, e-commerce, and e-tailer.
