<b>Present Perfect</b><br /><br />
The Present Perfect is used to indicate a link between the present and the past. The time of the action is before now but not specified, and we are often more interested in the result than in the action itself.
<br />
The present perfect of any verb is composed of two elements : the appropriate form of the auxiliary verb to have (present tense), plus the past participle of the main verb. The past participle of a regular verb is base+ed, e.g. played, arrived, looked.

&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You have seen that movie many times.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Have you seen that movie many times?</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You have not seen that movie many times.</font><br /><br /><b>1. Unspecified Time Before Now</b><br /><br />We use the Present Perfect to say that an action happened at an unspecified time before now. The exact time is not important. You CANNOT use the Present Perfect with specific time expressions such as: yesterday, one year ago, last week, when I was a child, when I lived in Japan, at that moment, that day, one day, etc. We CAN use the Present Perfect with unspecific expressions such as: ever, never, once, many times, several times, before, so far, already, yet, etc.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I have seen that movie twenty times.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I think I have met him once before.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    There have been many earthquakes in California.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    People have traveled to the Moon.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    People have not traveled to Mars.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Have you read the book yet?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Nobody has ever climbed that mountain.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    A: Has there ever been a war in the United States?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    B: Yes, there has been a war in the United States.</font><br /><br /><b>2. How Do You Actually Use the Present Perfect?</b><br /><br />The concept of "unspecified time" can be very confusing to English learners. It is best to associate Present Perfect with the following topics:<br /><br /><b>2.1. Experience</b><br /><br />You can use the Present Perfect to describe your experience. It is like saying, "I have the experience of..." You can also use this tense to say that you have never had a certain experience. The Present Perfect is NOT used to describe a specific event.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I have been to France.</font><br /><i>    THIS SENTENCE MEANS THAT YOU HAVE HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING IN FRANCE. MAYBE YOU HAVE BEEN THERE ONCE, OR SEVERAL TIMES.</i><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I have been to France three times.</font><br /><i>    YOU CAN ADD THE NUMBER OF TIMES AT THE END OF THE SENTENCE.</i><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I have never been to France.</font><br /><i>    THIS SENTENCE MEANS THAT YOU HAVE NOT HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF GOING TO FRANCE.</i><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I think I have seen that movie before.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He has never traveled by train.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Joan has studied two foreign languages.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    A: Have you ever met him?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    B: No, I have not met him.</font><br /><br /><b>2.2. Change Over Time</b><br /><br />We often use the Present Perfect to talk about change that has happened over a period of time.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You have grown since the last time I saw you.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The government has become more interested in arts education.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Japanese has become one of the most popular courses at the university since the Asian studies program was established.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    My English has really improved since I moved to Australia.</font><br /><br /><b>2.3. Accomplishments</b><br /><br />We often use the Present Perfect to list the accomplishments of individuals and humanity. You cannot mention a specific time.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Man has walked on the Moon.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Our son has learned how to read.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Doctors have cured many deadly diseases.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Scientists have split the atom.</font><br /><br /><b>2.4. An Uncompleted Action You Are Expecting</b><br /><br />We often use the Present Perfect to say that an action which we expected has not happened. Using the Present Perfect suggests that we are still waiting for the action to happen.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    James has not finished his homework yet.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Susan hasn't mastered Japanese, but she can communicate.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Bill has still not arrived.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The rain hasn't stopped.</font><br /><br /><b>2.5. Multiple Actions at Different Times</b><br /><br />We also use the Present Perfect to talk about several different actions which have occurred in the past at different times. Present Perfect suggests the process is not complete and more actions are possible.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The army has attacked that city five times.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I have had four quizzes and five tests so far this semester.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    We have had many major problems while working on this project.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She has talked to several specialists about her problem, but nobody knows why she is sick.</font><br /><br /><b>3. Time Expressions with Present Perfect</b><br /><br />When we use the Present Perfect it means that something has happened at some point in our lives before now. Remember, the exact time the action happened is not important.<br /><br />Sometimes, we want to limit the time we are looking in for an experience. We can do this with expressions such as: in the last week, in the last year, this week, this month, so far, up to now, etc.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Have you been to Mexico in the last year?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I have seen that movie six times in the last month.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    They have had three tests in the last week.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She graduated from university less than three years ago. She has worked for three different companies so far.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    My car has broken down three times this week.</font><br /><br />"Last year" and "in the last year" are very different in meaning. "Last year" means the year before now, and it is considered a specific time which requires Simple Past. "In the last year" means from 365 days ago until now. It is not considered a specific time, so it requires Present Perfect.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I went to Mexico last year.</font><br /><i>    I WENT TO MEXICO IN THE CALENDAR YEAR BEFORE THIS ONE.</i><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I have been to Mexico in the last year.</font><br /><i>    I HAVE BEEN TO MEXICO AT LEAST ONCE AT SOME POINT BETWEEN 365 DAYS AGO AND NOW.</i><br /><br /><b>4. Duration From the Past Until Now (Non-Continuous Verbs)</b><br /><br />With Non-Continuous Verbs and non-continuous uses of Mixed Verbs, we use the Present Perfect to show that something started in the past and has continued up until now. "For five minutes," "for two weeks," and "since Tuesday" are all durations which can be used with the Present Perfect.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I have had a cold for two weeks.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She has been in England for six months.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Mary has loved chocolate since she was a little girl.</font><br /><br />Although the above use of Present Perfect is normally limited to Non-Continuous Verbs and non-continuous uses of Mixed Verbs, the words "live," "work," "teach," and "study" are sometimes used in this way even though they are NOT Non-Continuous Verbs.<br /><br /><b>5. Position of Adverbs</b><br /><br />The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You have only seen that movie one time.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Have you only seen that movie one time?</font><br /><br /><b>6. Active / Passive</b><br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Many tourists have visited that castle. <font color='Black'><i>ACTIVE</i></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    That castle has been visited by many tourists. <font color='Black'><i>PASSIVE</i></font></font><br />
