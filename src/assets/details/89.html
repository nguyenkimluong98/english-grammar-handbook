<b>Past Continuous</b><br /><br />
The past continuous describes actions or events in a time before now, which began in the past and is still going on at the time of speaking. In other words, it expresses an unfinished or incomplete action in the past.<br />
The past continuous of any verb is composed of two parts : the past tense of the verb "to be" (was/were), and the base of the main verb +ing.

<br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She was crying yesterday.</font>
<br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    They were climbing on a hill.</font>
<br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You were studying when she called.</font>
<br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Were you studying when she called?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You were not studying when she called.</font><br /><br /><b>1. Interrupted Action in the Past</b><br /><br />Use the Past Continuous to indicate that a longer action in the past was interrupted. The interruption is usually a shorter action in the Simple Past. Remember this can be a real interruption or just an interruption in time.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I was watching TV when she called.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    When the phone rang, she was writing a letter.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    While we were having the picnic, it started to rain.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    What were you doing when the earthquake started?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I was listening to my iPod, so I didn't hear the fire alarm.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You were not listening to me when I told you to turn the oven off.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    While John was sleeping last night, someone stole his car.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Sammy was waiting for us when we got off the plane.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    While I was writing the email, the computer suddenly went off.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    A: What were you doing when you broke your leg?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    B: I was snowboarding.</font><br /><br /><b>2. Specific Time as an Interruption</b><br /><br />In USE 1, described above, the Past Continuous is interrupted by a shorter action in the Simple Past. However, you can also use a specific time as an interruption.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Last night at 6 PM, I was eating dinner.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    At midnight, we were still driving through the desert.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Yesterday at this time, I was sitting at my desk at work.</font><br /><br />In the Simple Past, a specific time is used to show when an action began or finished. In the Past Continuous, a specific time only interrupts the action.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Last night at 6 PM, I ate dinner.</font><br /><i>    I STARTED EATING AT 6 PM.</i><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Last night at 6 PM, I was eating dinner.</font><br /><i>    I STARTED EARLIER; AND AT 6 PM, I WAS IN THE PROCESS OF EATING DINNER.</i><br /><br /><b>3. Parallel Actions</b><br /><br />When you use the Past Continuous with two actions in the same sentence, it expresses the idea that both actions were happening at the same time. The actions are parallel.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I was studying while he was making dinner.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    While Ellen was reading, Tim was watching television.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Were you listening while he was talking?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I wasn't paying attention while I was writing the letter, so I made several mistakes.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    What were you doing while you were waiting?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Thomas wasn't working, and I wasn't working either.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    They were eating dinner, discussing their plans, and having a good time.</font><br /><br /><b>4. Atmosphere</b><br /><br />In English, we often use a series of parallel actions to describe the atmosphere at a particular time in the past.<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    When I walked into the office, several people were busily typing, some were talking on the phones, the boss was yelling directions, and customers were waiting to be helped. One customer was yelling at a secretary and waving his hands. Others were complaining to each other about the bad service.</font><br /><br /><b>5. Repetition and Irritation with "Always"</b><br /><br />The Past Continuous with words such as "always" or "constantly" expresses the idea that something irritating or shocking often happened in the past. The concept is very similar to the expression "used to" but with negative emotion. Remember to put the words "always" or "constantly" between "be" and "verb+ing."<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She was always coming to class late.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He was constantly talking. He annoyed everyone.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I didn't like them because they were always complaining.</font><br /><br /><b>6. While vs. When</b><br /><br />Clauses are groups of words which have meaning, but are often not complete sentences. Some clauses begin with the word "when" such as "when she called" or "when it bit me." Other clauses begin with "while" such as "while she was sleeping" and "while he was surfing." When you talk about things in the past, "when" is most often followed by the verb tense Simple Past, whereas "while" is usually followed by Past Continuous. "While" expresses the idea of "during that time." Study the examples below. They have similar meanings, but they emphasize different parts of the sentence.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I was studying when she called.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    While I was studying, she called.</font><br /><br /><b>7. Non-Continuous Verbs / Mixed Verbs</b><br /><br />It is important to remember that Non-Continuous Verbs cannot be used in any continuous tenses. Also, certain non-continuous meanings for Mixed Verbs cannot be used in continuous tenses. Instead of using Past Continuous with these verbs, you must use Simple Past.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Jane was being at my house when you arrived. <font color='Red'><b>Not Correct</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Jane was at my house when you arrived. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br /><b>8. Position of Adverbs</b><br /><br />The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You were just studying when she called.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Were you just studying when she called?</font><br /><br /><b>9. Active / Passive</b><br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The salesman was helping the customer when the thief came into the store. <font color='Black'><i>ACTIVE</i></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The customer was being helped by the salesman when the thief came into the store. <font color='Black'><i>PASSIVE</i></font></font><br />
