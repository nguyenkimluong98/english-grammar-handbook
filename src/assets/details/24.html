<b>Types of Verbs</b><br /><br />Before you begin the verb tense lessons, it is extremely important to understand that NOT all English verbs are the same. English verbs are divided into three groups: Normal Verbs, Non-Continuous Verbs, and Mixed Verbs.<br /><br /><b>Group I Normal Verbs</b><br /><br />Most verbs are "Normal Verbs." These verbs are usually physical actions which you can see somebody doing. These verbs can be used in all tenses.<br /><br /><b>Normal Verbs</b><br /><br />to run, to walk, to eat, to fly, to go, to say, to touch, etc.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />    I eat dinner every day.<br />    I am eating dinner now.<br /><br /><b>Group II Non-Continuous Verbs</b><br /><br />The second group, called "Non-Continuous Verbs," is smaller. These verbs are usually things you cannot see somebody doing. These verbs are rarely used in continuous tenses. They include:<br /><br /><b>Abstract Verbs</b><br /><br />to be, to want, to cost, to seem, to need, to care, to contain, to owe, to exist...<br /><br /><b>Possession Verbs</b><br /><br />to possess, to own, to belong...<br /><br /><b>Emotion Verbs</b><br /><br />to like, to love, to hate, to dislike, to fear, to envy, to mind...<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He is needing help now. <font color='Red'><b>Not Correct</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He needs help now. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He is wanting a drink now. <font color='Red'><b>Not Correct</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He wants a drink now. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br /><b>Group III Mixed Verbs</b><br /><br />The third group, called "Mixed Verbs," is the smallest group. These verbs have more than one meaning. In a way, each meaning is a unique verb. Some meanings behave like "Non-Continuous Verbs," while other meanings behave like "Normal Verbs."<br /><br /><b>Mixed Verbs</b><br /><br />to appear, to feel, to have, to hear, to look, to see, to weigh...<br /><br /><b>List of Mixed Verbs with Examples and Definitions:</b><br /><br />to appear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Donna appears confused.
