<b>Ought To</b><br /><br />"Ought to" is used to advise or make recommendations. "Ought to" also expresses assumption or expectation as well as strong probability, often with the idea that something is deserved. "Ought not" (without "to") is used to advise against doing something, although Americans prefer the less formal forms "should not" or "had better not."<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You ought to stop smoking. recommendation</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Jim ought to get the promotion.
