<b>Who, Whom, Whose</b><br /><br /><b>1. Subjects, Objects and Possessive Forms</b><br /><br />To understand how to use "who," "whom," and "whose," you first have to understand the difference between subjects, objects, and possessive forms.<br /><br />Subjects do an action:<br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He loves movies.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She goes to school.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    We enjoy Chinese food.</font><br /><br />Objects receive an action:<br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The teachers like him.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Thomas knows her.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The actor smiled at us.</font><br /><br />Possessive forms tell us the person something belongs to:<br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    His bike is broken.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I like her new book.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The teacher graded our homework.</font><br /><br /><b>2. "Who" is a Subject Pronoun</b><br /><br />"Who" is a subject pronoun like "he," "she" and "we" in the examples above. We use "who" to ask which person does an action or which person is a certain way.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Who made the birthday cake?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Who is in the kitchen?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Who is going to do the dishes?</font><br /><br /><b>3. "Whom" is an Object Pronoun</b><br /><br />"Whom" is an object pronoun like "him," "her" and "us." We use "whom" to ask which person receives an action.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Whom are you going to invite?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Whom did he blame for the accident?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Whom did he hire to do the job?</font><br /><br /><b>4. "Whose" is a Possessive Pronoun</b><br /><br />"Whose" is a possessive pronoun like "his," "her" and "our." We use "whose" to find out which person something belongs to.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Whose camera is this?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Whose dog is barking outside?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Whose cell phone keeps ringing?</font><br /><br /><b>5. "Who," "Whom" and "Whose" in Indirect Questions</b><br /><br />The sentence below contains an example of an indirect question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I don't know whom he invited.</font><br /><br />Such sentences usually start with a phrase such as: "I am not sure" or "He doesn't know" or "We don't care." Just ignore the first part of the sentence and look at the indirect question when deciding whether to use "who," "whom" or "whose." Ask yourself if the indirect question requires a subject, object, or possessive form.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He doesn't know who the boss of the company is. <font color='Black'><i>SUBJECT OF THE INDIRECT QUESTION</i></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I don't care whom you invite. <font color='Black'><i>OBJECT OF THE INDIRECT QUESTION</i></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She isn't sure whose car that is. <font color='Black'><i>"WHOSE" SHOWS POSSESSION OF CAR.</i></font></font><br /><br /><b>6. "Who," "Whom" and "Whose" in Adjective Clauses</b><br /><br />The sentence below contains an example of an adjective clause:<br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I know the man who won the contest.</font><br /><br />Adjective clauses are used to describe a noun in the main sentence. In the example above, the adjective clause tells us about "the man." Just ignore the main sentence and look at the adjective clause when deciding whether to use "who," "whom" or "whose." Ask yourself if the adjective clause requires a subject, object, or possessive form.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    We knew the actress who starred in the movie. <font color='Black'><i>SUBJECT OF ADJECTIVE CLAUSE</i></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    They hired the man whom we interviewed last week. <font color='Black'><i>OBJECT OF ADJECTIVE CLAUSE</i></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She knew the family whose house we bought. <font color='Black'><i>"WHOSE" SHOWS POSSESSION OF HOUSE.</i></font></font><br /><br /><b>7. "Whom" Less Common</b><br /><br />The form "whom" is becoming less and less common in English. Many native English speakers think "whom" sounds outdated or strange. This trend is particularly common in the United States. Especially when combined with prepositions, most people prefer to use "who" as the object pronoun. To most native English speakers, the examples below sound quite natural.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Who did you come to the party with?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I don't know who he gave the book to.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    That is the woman who I was talking to.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Who did you get that from?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Do you have any idea who he sold his car to?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    That is the person who I got the information from.</font><br />
