<b>B. Past Unreal Conditional</b><br /><br><b>Structure:</b><br /><br /><b><i>If ... Past Perfect ..., ... would have + past participle ... <br /><br />... would have + past participle ... if ... Past Perfect ...</i></b><br /><br />We use the third conditional when talking about things which are contrary to the past facts. In other words: events that did not happen in the past.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />

&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<font color='blue'>If I had woken up on time, I would have taken the bus.</font><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(What really happened was that I didn't wake up on time, and so I didn't take the bus.)<br>
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<font color='blue'>Tom would have helped us if he had known we were there.</font><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(What really happened was that he didn't know we were there, and so he didn't help us.)<br>	
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<font color='blue'>If I had told Sarah the truth, I would have felt much better.</font><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(What really happened was that I didn't tell Sarah the truth, and so I didn't feel so good.)<br>
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<font color='blue'>If it had rained, you would have gotten wet.</font><br />	
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<font color='blue'>You would have passed your exam if you had worked harder.</font><br />	
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<font color='blue'>If you hadn't lied to me before, I would have believed you.</font><br />

<b>1. Use "If"</b><br /><br />Only the word "if" is used with the Past Unreal Conditional because you are discussing imaginary situations. "When" cannot be used.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I would have bought that computer when it had been cheaper. <font color='Red'><b>Wrong</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I would have bought that computer if it had been cheaper. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br /><b>2. Conditional with Modal Verbs</b><br /><br />There are some special conditional forms for modal verbs in English:<br /><br />would have + can = could have<br /><br />would have + shall = should have<br /><br />would have + may = might have<br /><br />The words "can," "shall" and "may" cannot be used with "would have." Instead, they must be used in these special forms.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />

&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Lina might have gotten the job if she hadn't been so nervous.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I had gone to Egypt, I could have learned Arabic.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If she had had time, she might have gone to the party.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If she had known what to do, she should have told us.</font><br /><br />

The words "could," should," "might" and "ought to" include Conditional, so you cannot combine them with "would have."<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I had had more time, I could have exercised after work.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If he had invited you, you might have gone.</font><br /><br />
