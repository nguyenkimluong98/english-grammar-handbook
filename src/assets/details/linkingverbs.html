<b>Linking Verbs</b>
<br /><br />

A linking verb is a verb which connects a subject to its predicate without expressing an action. A linking verb is used to re-identify or describe its subject.<br><br>
The word, phrase, or clause which follows a linking verb to re-identify or describe the subject is called the subject complement.

<b>1. A List of Linking Verbs</b><br /><br />
The most common linking verb is the verb <i>to be</i>. Other common ones relate to the five senses (<i>to look</i>, <i>to feel</i>, <i>to smell</i>, <i>to sound</i>, and <i>to taste</i>). Here is a list of common linking verbs:<br><br>

&nbsp;&bull;to be<br />
(In all its forms, e.g., <i>am</i>, <i>is</i>, <i>are</i>, <i>was</i>, <i>were</i>, <i>will be</i>, <i>was being</i>, <i>has been</i>.)<br />
&nbsp;&bull;to appear<br />
&nbsp;&bull;to be<br />
&nbsp;&bull;to become<br />
&nbsp;&bull;to feel<br />
&nbsp;&bull;to look<br />
&nbsp;&bull;to seem<br />
&nbsp;&bull;to smell<br />
&nbsp;&bull;to sound<br />
&nbsp;&bull;to taste<br />

<b>2. Linking Verbs Used to Re-identify the Subject</b><br />
Here are some examples of linking verbs re-identifying the subject:<br><br>

&nbsp;&bull;Peter <b>is</b> a beast.<br />
&nbsp;&bull;His father <b>was</b> the headmaster. <br />
&nbsp;&bull;This project <b>is</b> a disaster. <br />
<br />
<b>3. Linking Verbs Modifying (Describing) the Subject</b><br />
Here are some examples of linking verbs modifying the subject:<br><br>

&nbsp;&bull;Terry <b>seems</b> drunk.<br />
&nbsp;&bull;The soup <b>smells</b> delicious.<br /> 
&nbsp;&bull;His voice <b>sounds</b> flat.<br />

<br />
<b>4. Linking Verbs Are Not Action Verbs</b><br /><br />
The verbs <i>to be</i>, <i>to become</i>, and <i>to seem</i> are always linking verbs. They always link the subject to the predicate to re-identify or describe it. However, the other verbs in the list above are not always linking verbs. Remember, linking verbs do not express an action. However, some of the verbs in our list can express an action. For example: <br><br>


&nbsp;&bull;He <b>smells</b> the soup.<br />
(In this example, <i>smells</i> is not a linking verb. This time, it is an action verb. It has taken a direct object. <i>He</i> is doing something to <i>the soup</i>.)<br />

&nbsp;&bull;John <b>smells</b> awful.<br />
(In this example, <i>smells</i> is a linking verb. It links the subject <i>John</i> to the adjective <i>awful</i> to modify <i>John</i>.)
<br /><br />
Here is another example:<br><br>


&nbsp;&bull;The inspector <b>will feel</b> the fabric.<br />
(In this example, <i>will feel</i> is not a linking verb. This time, it is an action verb. It has taken a direct object. <i>The inspector </i> will do something to <i>the fabric</i>.)<br />
&nbsp;&bull;The fabric <b>will feel</b> soft.<br />
(In this example, <i>will feel</i> is a linking verb. It links the subject <i>The fabric</i> to the adjective <i>soft</i>.)

<br /><br />
<b>5. Linking Verbs in the Passive Voice and Progressive Tense</b><br /><br />
The verb <i>to be</i> is used to form the passive voice and the progressive tenses. For example:<br><br>


&nbsp;&bull;He <b>was</b> painted.<br />
(This is the passive voice.)<br />
&nbsp;&bull;He <b>is</b> complaining.<br />
(This is the present progressive tense.)<br />

<br />
As past participles (here, <i>painted</i>) and present participles (here, <i>complaining</i>) are classified as adjectives, the constructions above are no different from these:<br><br>


&nbsp;&bull;He <b>was</b> happy.<br />
&nbsp;&bull;He <b>is</b> happy.<br />

<br />
Therefore, the "to be" part of a passive construction (here, <i><b>was</b> painted</i>) and a verb tense (here, <i><b>is</b> complaining</i>) can be considered a linking verb.
