<b>Shall</b><br /><br />"Shall" is used to indicate future action. It is most commonly used in sentences with "I" or "we," and is often found in suggestions, such as "Shall we go?" "Shall" is also frequently used in promises or voluntary actions. In formal English, the use of "shall" to describe future events often expresses inevitability or predestination. "Shall" is much more commonly heard in British English than in American English; Americans prefer to use other forms, although they do sometimes use "shall" in suggestions or formalized language.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Shall I help you? suggestion</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I shall never forget where I came from. promise</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He shall become our next king. predestination</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I'm afraid Mr. Smith shall become our new director. inevitability</font><br /><br /><b>More Examples of "Shall"</b><br /><br />shall<br /><i>FUTURE ACTION</i><br />(British form)<br />I shall be replaced by someone from the New York office.<br />I shall not be replaced after all.<br /><br />I shall be there by 8:00.<br />I shall not be there.
