<b>Have To</b><br />

<p>We use <b>have to</b> to talk about strong obligation that comes from somewhere else, for example from you boss, you parents, a rule at school or work.</p>

<p><b>Examples:</b><br>
<br><i>
<font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;You have to pass your exams or the university will not accept you.</font><br>
<font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;We have to give him our answer today or lose out on the contract.</font><br>
<font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;I have to be home by ten. (My parents told me so.)</font><br>
<font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;I must be home by ten. I have a very difficult day tomorrow. (It is my own decision.)</font><br>
<br>
<font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;I have to get up early, because I start work at 7. (It is a rule.)</font><br>
<font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;I should get up early. (Now I stay in bed until lunchtime.)</font></i></p>


<p><b>Don't have to</b> means that there isn't any obligation at all,<br>
there is no need to do it.</p>

<p><b>Don't have to</b> is different from <b>shouldn't</b> and <b>mustn't</b>.</p>

<p><b>Examples:</b><br>
<br><i>
<font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;I don't have to get up early at weekend.</font>
<br>(I can stay in bed as long as I want.)<br>
<br>
<font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;You mustn't tell lies. (It is very bad to tell lies.)</font><br>
<br>
<font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;You don't have to go with me.</font>
<br>(You can go with me if you want to.)<br>
<br>
<font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;You shouldn't smoke. (It is bad for your health.)</font><br>
</i></p>


<p>In spoken British English you can also use <b>have got to</b> and&nbsp;<b>haven't got to</b>.</p>

<p><b>Examples:</b><br>
<br><i>
<font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Pamela is a waitress. She's got to work at weekends.</font><br>
<font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Have I got to do it right now?</font><br>
<font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;I haven't got to take my sister to school, my parents do it.</font><br>
</i></p>

<p><b>NOTE: </b> We do not use <b>have to</b> when we talk about what is a good idea to do, but we don't do&nbsp;it yet. Instead, we use <b>should</b>.</p>
