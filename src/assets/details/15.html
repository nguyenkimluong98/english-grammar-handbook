<b>Past Conditionals</b><br /><b>Past Real Conditional</b><br /><b>FORM</b><br /><br />[If / When ... Simple Past ..., ... Simple Past ...]<br /><br />[... Simple Past... if / when ... Simple Past ...]<br />USE<br /><br />The Past Real Conditional describes what you used to do in particular real-life situations. It suggests that your habits have changed and you do not usually do these things today.<br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I went to a friend's house for dinner, I usually took a bottle of wine or some flowers. I don't do that anymore.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    When I had a day off from work, I often went to the beach. Now, I never get time off.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If the weather was nice, she often walked to work. Now, she usually drives.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Jerry always helped me with my homework when he had time. But he doesn't do that anymore.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    A: What did you usually do when it rained?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    B: I usually stayed at home.</font><br /><br /><b>IMPORTANT Used to</b><br /><br />The form "used to" expresses the idea that something was an old habit that stopped in the past. This form is commonly used in Past Real Conditional sentences to emphasize that something was a habit. The examples below have the same meaning as the examples above.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I went to a friend's house for dinner, I used to take a bottle of wine or some flowers. I don't do that anymore.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    When I had a day off from work, I used to go to the beach.

Using "if" suggests that something happened less frequently. Using "when" suggests that something happened regularly.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    When I had a day off from work, I usually went to the beach.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I regularly had days off from work.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I had a day off from work, I usually went to the beach.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I rarely had days off from work.</font><br /><br /><b>Past Unreal Conditional</b><br /><b>FORM</b><br /><br />[If ... Past Perfect ..., ... would have + past participle ... ]<br /><br />[... would have + past participle ... if ... Past Perfect ...]<br /><b>USE</b><br /><br />The Past Unreal Conditional is used to talk about imaginary situations in the past. You can describe what you would have done differently or how something could have happened differently if circumstances had been different.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I had owned a car, I would have driven to work. But I didn't own one, so I took the bus.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She would have traveled around the world if she had had more money. But she didn't have much money, so she never traveled.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I would have read more as a child if I hadn't watched so much TV. Unfortunately, I did watch a lot of TV, so I never read for entertainment.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Mary would have gotten the job and moved to Japan if she had studied Japanese in school instead of French.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If Jack had worked harder, he would have earned more money. Unfortunately, he was lazy and he didn't earn much.</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    A: What would you have done if you had won the lottery last week?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    B: I would have bought a house.</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    A: What city would you have chosen if you had decided to move to the United States?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    B: I would have chosen Seattle.</font><br /><br /><b>IMPORTANT Only use "If"</b><br /><br />Only the word "if" is used with the Past Unreal Conditional because you are discussing imaginary situations. "When" cannot be used.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I would have bought that computer when it had been cheaper. <font color='Red'><b>Not Correct</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I would have bought that computer if it had been cheaper. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br /><b>EXCEPTION Conditional with Modal Verbs</b><br /><br />There are some special conditional forms for modal verbs in English:<br /><br />would have + can = could have<br /><br />would have + shall = should have<br /><br />would have + may = might have<br /><br />The words "can," "shall" and "may" cannot be used with "would have." Instead, they must be used in these special forms.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I had gone to Egypt, I could have learned Arabic.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If she had had time, she might have gone to the party.</font><br /><br />The words "could," should," "might" and "ought to" include Conditional, so you cannot combine them with "would have."<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I had had more time, I could have exercised after work.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If he had invited you, you might have gone.</font><br /><br />
