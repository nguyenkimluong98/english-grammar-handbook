<b>Future Perfect</b><br /><br />
The future perfect tense refers to a completed action in the future. When we use this tense we are projecting ourselves forward into the future and looking back at an action that will be completed some time later than now. It is most often used with a time expression.
<br /><br />
Future Perfect has two different forms: "will have done" and "be going to have done." Unlike Simple Future forms, Future Perfect forms are usually interchangeable.<br /><br /><b>1. Future Perfect with "Will"</b><br /><br />will have + past participle<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You will have perfected your English by the time you come back from the U.S.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Will you have perfected your English by the time you come back from the U.S.?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You will not have perfected your English by the time you come back from the U.S.</font><br /><br /><b>2. Future Perfect with "Be Going To"</b><br /><br />am/is/are + going to have + past participle<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You are going to have perfected your English by the time you come back from the U.S.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Are you going to have perfected your English by the time you come back from the U.S.?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You are not going to have perfected your English by the time you come back from the U.S.</font><br /><br /><b><i>It is possible to use either "will" or "be going to" to create the Future Perfect with little or no difference in meaning.</i></b><br /><br /><b>3. Completed Action Before Something in the Future</b><br /><br />The Future Perfect expresses the idea that something will occur before another action in the future. It can also show that something will happen before a specific time in the future.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    By next November, I will have received my promotion.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    By the time he gets home, she is going to have cleaned the entire house.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I am not going to have finished this test by 3 o'clock.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Will she have learned enough Chinese to communicate before she moves to Beijing?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Sam is probably going to have completed the proposal by the time he leaves this afternoon.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    By the time I finish this course, I will have taken ten tests.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    How many countries are you going to have visited by the time you turn 50?</font><br /><br />Notice in the examples above that the reference points (marked in italics) are in Simple Present rather than Simple Future. This is because the interruptions are in time clauses, and you cannot use future tenses in time clauses.<br /><br /><b>4. Duration Before Something in the Future (Non-Continuous Verbs)</b><br /><br />With Non-Continuous Verbs and some non-continuous uses of Mixed Verbs, we use the Future Perfect to show that something will continue up until another action in the future.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I will have been in London for six months by the time I leave.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    By Monday, Susan is going to have had my book for a week.</font><br /><br />Although the above use of Future Perfect is normally limited to Non-Continuous Verbs and non-continuous uses of Mixed Verbs, the words "live," "work," "teach," and "study" are sometimes used in this way even though they are NOT Non-Continuous Verbs.<br /><br /><b>5. No Future in Time Clauses</b><br /><br />Like all future forms, the Future Perfect cannot be used in clauses beginning with time expressions such as: when, while, before, after, by the time, as soon as, if, unless, etc. Instead of Future Perfect, Present Perfect is used.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I am going to see a movie when I will have finished my homework. <font color='Red'><b>Not Correct</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I am going to see a movie when I have finished my homework. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br /><b>6. Position of Adverbs</b><br /><br />The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You will only have learned a few words.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Will you only have learned a few words?</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You are only going to have learned a few words.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Are you only going to have learned a few words?</font><br /><br /><b>7.
