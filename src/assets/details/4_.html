<h5>Adjectives and Adverbs</h5>
<h5>Definitions</h5>
			<p>An <b>adjective</b> is a word or set of words that <b>modifies</b> (i.e., describes) a noun or pronoun. Adjectives may come before the word they modify. </p>
            <p><b><i>Examples:</i></b><br />
                <i>That is a <b>cute</b> puppy.<br>
                She likes a <b>high school</b> senior.</i></p>
                <p>Adjectives may also follow the word they modify:</p>
                <p><b><i>Examples:</i></b><br />
                <i>That puppy looks <b>cute.</b><br>
                The technology is <b>state-of-the-art.</b></i></p>
			<p>An <b>adverb</b> is a word or set of words that modifies verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.
</p>
                <p><b><i>Examples:</i></b><br />
                <i>He speaks <b>slowly</i></b> (modifies the verb <i>speaks</i>)<br>
                <i>He is <b>especially</b> clever</i> (modifies the adjective <i>clever</i>)<br>
                <i>He speaks <b>all too</b> slowly</i> (modifies the adverb <i>slowly</i>)</p>
                
                <p>An adverb answers how, when, where, or to what extent&mdash;how often or how much (e.g., <i>daily, completely</i>).
</p>
                <p><b><i>Examples:</i></b><br />
                <i>He speaks <b>slowly</b></i> (answers the question <i>how</i>)<br>
                <i>He speaks <b>very</b> slowly</i> (answers the question <i>how slowly</i>)</p>

			<div class="rule">
            <p><b><i><span fontColor="blue">Rule 1.</span></i></b> Many adverbs end in <i>-ly</i>, but many do not. Generally, if a word can have <i>-ly</i> added to its adjective form, place it there to form an adverb. </p>
			
            <p><b><i>Examples:</i></b><br />
                <i>She thinks quick/<b>quickly</b>.</i><br />
                How does she think? <i>Quickly.</i><br /><br />
                <i>She is a <b>quick</b>/quickly thinker.</i><br />
                <i>Quick</i> is an adjective describing <i>thinker</i>, so no <i>-ly</i> is attached.<br /><br />
                <i>She thinks <b>fast</b>/fastly.</i><br />
                <i>Fast</i> answers the question <i>how</i>, so it is an adverb. But <i>fast</i> never has <i>-ly</i> attached to it.<br /><br />
                <i>We performed bad/<b>badly</b>.</i><br />
                <i>Badly</i> describes <i>how</i> we performed, so <i>-ly</i> is added.
                </p>    
</div>
            
            <div class="rule">
            <p><b><i><span fontColor="blue">Rule 2.</span></i></b> Adverbs that answer the question <i>how</i> sometimes cause grammatical problems. It can be a challenge to determine if <i>-ly</i> should be attached. Avoid the trap of <i>-ly</i> with linking verbs, such as <i>taste, smell, look, feel,</i> etc., that pertain to the senses. Adverbs are often misplaced in such sentences, which require adjectives instead. </p>
            
            <p><b><i>Examples:</i></b><br />
                <i>Roses smell <b>sweet</b>/sweetly.</i><br />
Do the roses actively smell with noses? No; in this case, <i>smell</i> is a linking verb&mdash;which requires an adjective to modify <i>roses</i>&mdash;so no <i>-ly.</i><br /><br />
<i>The woman looked <b>angry</b>/angrily to us.</i><br />
Did the woman look with her eyes, or are we describing her appearance? We are describing her appearance (she appeared angry), so no <i>-ly.</i><br /><br />
<i>The woman looked angry/<b>angrily</b> at the paint splotches.</i><br />
Here the woman actively looked (used her eyes), so the <i>-ly</i> is added.<br /><br />
<i>She feels <b>bad</b>/badly about the news.</i><br />
She is not feeling with fingers, so no <i>-ly.</i></p>
                </div>
            
            <div class="rule">
            <p><b><i><span fontColor="blue">Rule 3.</span></i></b> The word <i>good</i> is an adjective, whose adverb equivalent is <i>well.</i> </p>
            
                <p><b><i>Examples:</i></b><br />
                <i>You did a good job.</i><br />
<i>Good</i> describes the job.<br /><br />
<i>You did the job well.</i><br />
<i>Well</i> answers <i>how.</i><br /><br />
<i>You smell good today.</i><br />
<i>Good</i> describes your fragrance, not how you smell with your nose, so using the adjective is correct.<br /><br />
<i>You smell well for someone with a cold.</i><br />
You are actively smelling with your nose here, so use the adverb.</p>
</div>
            
            <div class="rule">
            <p><b><i><span fontColor="blue">Rule 4.</span></i></b> The word <i>well</i> can be an adjective, too. When referring to health, we often use <i>well</i> rather than <i>good.</i></p>
            
                <p><b><i>Examples:</i></b><br />
                <i>You do not look well today.<br />
I don't feel well, either.</i></p>
</div>
            
            
            <div class="rule">
            <p><b><i><span fontColor="blue">Rule 5.</span></i></b> Adjectives come in three forms, also called <b>degrees</b>. An adjective in its normal or usual form is called a <b>positive degree adjective</b>. There are also the <b>comparative</b> and <b>superlative</b> degrees, which are used for comparison, as in the following examples: </p>
			
			<b>Positive | Comparative | Superlative</b><br>
			<i>sweet | sweeter | sweetest</i><br>
			<i>bad | worse | worst</i><br>
			<i>efficient | more efficient | most efficient</i><br>
			
            <p>A common error in using adjectives and adverbs arises from using the wrong form of comparison. To compare two things, always use a <b>comparative</b> adjective:
</p>
                <p><b><i>Example:</i></b> <i>She is the <b>cleverer</b> of the two women (never cleverest)</i></p>
                <p>The word <i>cleverest</i> is what is called the <b>superlative</b> form of <i>clever</i>. Use it only when comparing three or more things:</p>
                <p><b><i>Example:</i></b> <i>She is the <b>cleverest</b> of them all.</i></p>
                <p><b><i>Incorrect:</i></b> <i>Chocolate or vanilla: which do you like best?</i></p>
                <p><b><i>Correct:</i></b> <i>Chocolate or vanilla: which do you like <b>better?</b></i></p>
            </div>
            
            
            <div class="rule">
            <p><b><i><span fontColor="blue">Rule 6.</span></i></b> <b>There are also three degrees of adverbs</b>. In formal usage, do not drop the <i>-ly</i> from an adverb when using the comparative form. </p>
                <p><b><i>Incorrect:</i></b> <i>She spoke quicker than he did.</i></p>
                <p><b><i>Correct:</i></b> <i>She spoke <b>more quickly</b> than he did.</i></p>
                <p><b><i>Incorrect:</i></b> <i>Talk quieter.</i></p>
                <p><b><i>Correct:</i></b> <i>Talk <b>more quietly.</b></i></p>
            </div>
            
            
            <div class="rule">
            <p><b><i><span fontColor="blue">Rule 7.</span></i></b> When <i>this, that, these,</i> and <i>those</i> are followed by a noun, they are adjectives. When they appear without a noun following them, they are pronouns. </p>
            <p><b><i>Examples:</i></b><br />
                <i>This house is for sale.</i><br />
<i>This</i> is an adjective.<br /><br />
<i>This is for sale.</i><br />
<i>This</i> is a pronoun.</p>
