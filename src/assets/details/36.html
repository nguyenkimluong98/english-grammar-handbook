1. A gerund is a noun made from a verb by adding "-ing." The gerund form of the verb "read" is "reading." You can use a gerund as the subject, the complement, or the object of a sentence.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Reading helps you learn English. subject of sentence</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Her favorite hobby is reading. complement of sentence</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I enjoy reading. object of sentence</font><br /><br />Gerunds can be made negative by adding "not."<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He enjoys not working.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The best thing for your health is not smoking.</font><br /><br />2. Infinitives are the "to" form of the verb. The infinitive form of "learn" is "to learn." You can also use an infinitive as the subject, the complement, or the object of a sentence.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    To learn is important. subject of sentence</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The most important thing is to learn. complement of sentence</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He wants to learn. object of sentence</font><br /><br />Infinitives can be made negative by adding "not."<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I decided not to go.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The most important thing is not to give up.</font><br /><br />3. Both gerunds and infinitives can be used as the subject or the complement of a sentence. However, as subjects or complements, gerunds usually sound more like normal, spoken English, whereas infinitives sound more abstract. In the following sentences, gerunds sound more natural and would be more common in everyday English. Infinitives emphasize the possibility or potential for something and sound more philosophical. If this sounds confusing, just remember that 90% of the time, you will use a gerund as the subject or complement of a sentence.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Learning is important. normal subject</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    To learn is important. abstract subject - less common</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The most important thing is learning. normal complement</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The most important thing is to learn. abstract complement - less common</font><br /><br />4. As the object of a sentence, it is more difficult to choose between a gerund or an infinitive. In such situations, gerunds and infinitives are not normally interchangeable. Usually, the main verb in the sentence determines whether you use a gerund or an infinitive.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He enjoys swimming. "Enjoy" requires a gerund.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He wants to swim. "Want" requires an infinitive.</font><br /><br />5. Some verbs are followed by gerunds as objects.

Gerunds can often be modified with possessive forms such as his, her, its, your, their, our, John's, Mary's, the machine's, and so on. This makes it clearer who or what is performing the action.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I enjoyed their singing. They were singing.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She understood his saying no to the offer.

Some verbs are followed by a noun plus an infinitive. In some situations, the noun is required.

Using a gerund suggests that you are referring to real activities or experiences. Using an infinitive suggests that you are talking about potential or possible activities or experiences. Because of this small difference in meaning, gerunds and infinitives cannot always be used interchangeably, such as in the examples below.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The British reporter likes living in New York. <font color='Black'><i>HE LIVES IN NEW YORK AND HE LIKES WHAT HE EXPERIENCES THERE.</i></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The British reporter likes to live in New York whenever he works in the United States. <font color='Black'><i>HE LIKES THE OPTION OR POSSIBILITY OF LIVING IN NEW YORK WHEN HE WORKS IN THE UNITED STATES.</i></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I like speaking French because it's such a beautiful language. <font color='Black'><i>I LIKE THE EXPERIENCE OF SPEAKING FRENCH, AND THE WAY IT MAKES ME FEEL WHEN I SPEAK THE LANGUAGE.</i></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I like to speak French when I'm in France. <font color='Black'><i>I PREFER THE OPTION OF SPEAKING FRENCH WHEN I AM IN FRANCE.</i></font></font><br /><br />15.
