<h1>Relative clauses</h1>

<p><p>We can use relative clauses to join two sentences, or to give more information about something.</p>

<p>I bought a new car. It is very fast.<br />
<strong>&#8594; I bought a new car that is very fast.</p></strong>

<p>She lives in New York. She likes living in New York.<br />
<strong>&#8594; She lives in New York, which she likes.</strong></p>

<h3>Defining and Non-defining</h3>
<p>A <strong>defining relative clause</strong> tells which noun we are talking about:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>I like the woman who lives next door.</font><br />
(If I don't say 'who lives next door', then we don't know which woman I mean).</p>

<p>A <strong>non-defining relative clause</strong> gives us extra information about something. We don't need this information to understand the sentence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>I live in London, which has some fantastic parks.</font><br />
(Everybody knows where London is, so 'which has some fantastic parks' is extra information).</p>


<h3><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Defining relative clauses:</h3>

<p><strong>1: The relative pronoun is the subject:</strong>

</p><p>First, let's consider when the relative pronoun is the subject of a defining relative clause. 

</p><p>We can use 'who', 'which' or 'that'. We use 'who' for people and 'which' for things. We can use 'that' for people or things.

</p><p>The relative clause can come after the subject or the object of the sentence. We can't drop the relative pronoun.

</p><p>For example (clause after the object of the sentence):<!-- google_ad_section_end --></p>

<p>&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>I'm looking for a secretary who / that can use a computer well.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>She has a son who / that is a doctor.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>We bought a house which / that is 200 years old.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>I sent a letter which / that arrived three weeks later.</font><br /></p>

<p>More examples (clause after the subject of the sentence):</p>

<p>&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>The people who / that live on the island are very friendly.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>The man who / that phoned is my brother.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>The camera which / that costs Â£100 is over there.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>The house which / that belongs to Julie is in London.</font><br /></p>

<p><strong>2: The relative pronoun is the object:</strong>

</p><p>Next, let's talk about when the relative pronoun is the object of the clause. In this case we can drop the relative pronoun if we want to. Again, the clause can come after the subject or the object of the sentence. Here are some examples:</p>

(Clause after the object)
<p>&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>She loves the chocolate (which / that) I bought.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>We went to the village (which / that) Lucy recommended.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>John met a woman (who / that) I had been to school with.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>The police arrested a man (who / that) Jill worked with.</font><br /></p>

(Clause after the subject)
<p>&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>The bike (which / that) I loved was stolen.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>The university (which / that) she likes is famous.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>The woman (who / that) my brother loves is from Mexico.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>The doctor (who / that) my grandmother liked lives in New York.</font><br /></p>

<h3>Non-defining relative clauses:</h3>

</p><p>We don't use 'that' in non-defining relative clauses, so we need to use 'which' if the pronoun refers to a thing, and 'who' if it refers to a person. We can't drop the relative pronoun in this kind of clause, even if the relative pronoun is the subject of the clause.

<p>(Clause comes after the subject)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>My boss, who is very nice, lives in Manchester.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>My sister, who I live with, knows a lot about cars.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>My bicycle, which I've had for more than ten years, is falling apart.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>My mother's house, which I grew up in, is very small.</font><br /></p>

<p>(Clause comes after the object)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>Yesterday I called our friend Julie, who lives in New York.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>The photographer called to the Queen, who looked annoyed.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>Last week I bought a new computer, which I don't like now.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>I really love the new Chinese restaurant, which we went to last night.</font><br /></p>

<h3>Prepositions and relative clauses</h3>

<p>If the verb in the relative clause needs a preposition, we put it at the end of the clause:</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&bull;<strong>listen to</strong></p>

<p>The music is good. Julie listens to the music.<br />
&#8594; The music (which / that) Julie listens <strong>to</strong> is good.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&bull;<strong>work with</strong></p>

<p>My brother met a woman. I used to work with the woman.<br />
&#8594; My brother met a woman (who / that) I used to work <strong>with</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&bull;<strong>go to</strong></p>

<p>The country is very hot. He went to the country.<br />
&#8594; The country (which / that) he went <strong>to</strong> is very hot.</p>


<p>&nbsp;&bull;<strong>come from</strong></p>

<p>I visited the city. John comes from the city.<br />
&#8594; I visited the city (that / which) John comes <strong>from</strong>.</p>


<p>&nbsp;&bull;<strong>apply for</strong></p>

<p>The job is well paid. She applied for the job.<br />
&#8594; The job (which / that) she applied <strong>for</strong> is well paid.</p>
 

<h3>Whose</h3>

<p>'Whose' is always the subject of the relative clause and can't be left out. It replaces a possessive. It can be used for people and things.</p>

<p>The dog is over there. The dog's / its owner lives next door.<br />
&#8594; The dog <strong>whose</strong> owner lives next door is over there.</p>

<p>The little girl is sad. The little girl's / her doll was lost.<br />
&#8594; The little girl <strong>whose</strong> doll was lost is sad.</p>

<p>The woman is coming tonight. Her car is a BMW.<br />
&#8594; The woman <strong>whose</strong> car is a BMW is coming tonight.</p>

<p>The house belongs to me. Its roof is very old.<br />
&#8594; The house <strong>whose</strong> roof is old belongs to me.</p>

<h3>Where / when / why</h3>

<p>We can sometimes use these question words instead of relative pronouns and prepositions.</p>

<p>I live in a city. I study in the city.<br /><br />
&#8594; I live in the city <strong>where</strong> I study.<br />
&#8594; I live in the city <strong>that / which</strong> I study <strong>in</strong>.<br />
&#8594; I live in the city <strong>in which</strong> I study.</p>

<p>The bar in Barcelona is still there. I met my wife in that bar.<br /><br />
&#8594; The bar in Barcelona <strong>where</strong> I met my wife is still there.<br />
&#8594; The bar in Barcelona <strong>that / which</strong> I met my wife <strong>in</strong> is still there.<br />

&#8594; The summer <strong>in which</strong> I graduated was long and hot.</p>
