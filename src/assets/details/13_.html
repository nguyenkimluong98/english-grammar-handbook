<b>Present Conditionals</b><br><br /><b>A. Present Real Conditional (Zero Conditional)</b><br /><br /><b>Structure:</b><br><br><b><i>If / When ... Simple Present ..., ... Simple Present ...<br /><br />... Simple Present ... if / when ... Simple Present ...</i></b><br /><br />We use the <b>Present Real Conditional</b> (zero conditional) when talking about things which are always true, or generally  true.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I always listen to music if I jog.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If you heat something, it becomes hotter.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If you boil an egg, it becomes solid.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Ice melts when you heat it.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    When I have a day off from work, I often go to the beach.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If the weather is nice, she walks to work.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Jerry helps me with my homework when he has time.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I read if there is nothing on TV.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If it rains, the grass gets wet.</font><br />
<br /><b>We can use "when" instead of "if."</b><br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    When I see Peter I always feel better.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    When she feels sick she lies in bed.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He starts yelling only when he gets really desperate.</font><br />
<br />
<b>B. Present Unreal Conditional (Second Conditional)</b><br /><br /><b>Structure:</b><br><br><b><i>If ... Simple Past ..., ... would + verb ...<br /><br />... would + verb ... if ... Simple Past ...</i></b><br /><br />We use the second conditional when talking about future events that are not likely to happen.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I won a million dollars, I would travel around the world.</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(There is a small possibility that I would actually win.)<br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I met him again, I would tell him the truth.</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(There is a small possibility that I would actually meet him again.)<br />

&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She would quit school if her parents agreed.</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(It is unlikely that her parents agree.)<br />

&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I would be surprised if I saw pigs in the sky.</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(It is very unlikely for me to see pigs in the sky.)<br />

&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I owned a car, I would drive to work. But I don't own a car.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She would travel around the world if she had more money. But she doesn't have much money.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I would read more if I didn't watch so much TV.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Mary would move to Japan if she spoke Japanese.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If they worked harder, they would earn more money.</font><br />
<br /><b>1. The verb BE</b><br /><br />The verb BE has a special rule in this case.<br>
Usually we say: I was, he was, she was, it was, we were, you were, they were.

However, in these cases, we use:
I were, he were, she were, it were, we were, you were, they were.

In other words: "were" is the only form.
<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I were you I would apologize.</font><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(In reality I am not you.)<br>
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I would fight back, if I were you.</font><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(In reality I am not you.)<br>
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If he were French, he would live in Paris.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If she were rich, she would buy a yacht.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I would play basketball if I were taller.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I would buy that computer if it were cheaper.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I would buy that computer if it was cheaper. <font color='Red'><b>Wrong</b></font> (But often said in conversation.)</font><br /><br /><b>2. Only use "If"</b><br />Only the word "if" is used with the Present Unreal Conditional because you are discussing imaginary situations. "When" cannot be used.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I would buy that computer when it were cheaper. <font color='Red'><b>Wrong</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I would buy that computer if it were cheaper. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br /><b>3. Conditional with Modal Verbs</b><br /><br />There are some special conditional forms for modal verbs in English:<br /><br />would + can = could<br /><br />would + shall = should<br /><br />would + may = might<br /><br />The words "can," "shall" and "may" cannot be used with "would." Instead, they must be used in these special forms.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I went to Egypt, I would can learn Arabic. <font color='Red'><b>Wrong</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I went to Egypt, I could learn Arabic. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If she had time, she would may go to the party. <font color='Red'><b>Wrong</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If she had time, she might go to the party. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br />The words "could," should," "might" and "ought to" include conditional, so you cannot combine them with "would."<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I had more time, I would could exercise after work. <font color='Red'><b>Wrong</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I had more time, I could exercise after work. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If he invited you, you really would should go. <font color='Red'><b>Wrong</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If he invited you, you really should go. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br />
