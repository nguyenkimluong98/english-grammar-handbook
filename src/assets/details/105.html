<b>Simple Future</b><br /><br />
The simple future refers to a time later than now, and expresses facts or certainty.
<br /><br />
Simple Future has two different forms in English: "will" and "be going to." Although the two forms can sometimes be used interchangeably, they often express two very different meanings. These different meanings might seem too abstract at first, but with time and practice, the differences will become clear. Both "will" and "be going to" refer to a specific time in the future.<br /><br /><b>1. Will</b><br /><br />will + verb<br /><br />

&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I won't leave until I've seen the manager!</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You will help him later.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Will you help him later?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You will not help him later.</font><br /><br /><b>2. Be Going To</b><br /><br />am/is/are + going to + verb<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You are going to meet Jane tonight.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Are you going to meet Jane tonight?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You are not going to meet Jane tonight.</font><br /><br /><b>3. "Will" to Express a Voluntary Action</b><br /><br />"Will" often suggests that a speaker will do something voluntarily. A voluntary action is one the speaker offers to do for someone else. Often, we use "will" to respond to someone else's complaint or request for help. We also use "will" when we request that someone help us or volunteer to do something for us. Similarly, we use "will not" or "won't" when we refuse to voluntarily do something.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I will send you the information when I get it.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I will translate the email, so Mr. Smith can read it.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Will you help me move this heavy table?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Will you make dinner?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I will not do your homework for you.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I won't do all the housework myself!</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    A: I'm really hungry.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    B: I'll make some sandwiches.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    A: I'm so tired. I'm about to fall asleep.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    B: I'll get you some coffee.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    A: The phone is ringing.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    B: I'll get it.</font><br /><br /><b>4. "Will" to Express a Promise</b><br /><br />"Will" is usually used in promises.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I will call you when I arrive.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I am elected President of the United States, I will make sure everyone has access to inexpensive health insurance.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I promise I will not tell him about the surprise party.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Don't worry, I'll be careful.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I won't tell anyone your secret.</font><br /><br /><b>5. "Be going to" to Express a Plan</b><br /><br />"Be going to" expresses that something is a plan. It expresses the idea that a person intends to do something in the future. It does not matter whether the plan is realistic or not.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He is going to spend his vacation in Hawaii.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She is not going to spend her vacation in Hawaii.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    A: When are we going to meet each other tonight?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    B: We are going to meet at 6 PM.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I'm going to be an actor when I grow up.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Michelle is going to begin medical school next year.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    They are going to drive all the way to Alaska.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Who are you going to invite to the party?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    A: Who is going to make John's birthday cake?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    B: Sue is going to make John's birthday cake.</font><br /><br /><b>6. "Will" or "Be Going to" to Express a Prediction</b><br /><br />Both "will" and "be going to" can express the idea of a general prediction about the future. Predictions are guesses about what might happen in the future. In "prediction" sentences, the subject usually has little control over the future and therefore USES 1-3 do not apply. In the following examples, there is no difference in meaning.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The year 2222 will be a very interesting year.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The year 2222 is going to be a very interesting year.</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    John Smith will be the next President.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    John Smith is going to be the next President.</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The movie "Zenith" will win several Academy Awards.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The movie "Zenith" is going to win several Academy Awards.</font><br /><br />In the Simple Future, it is not always clear which USE the speaker has in mind. Often, there is more than one way to interpret a sentence's meaning.<br /><br /><b>7. No Future in Time Clauses</b><br /><br />Like all future forms, the Simple Future cannot be used in clauses beginning with time expressions such as: when, while, before, after, by the time, as soon as, if, unless, etc. Instead of Simple Future, Simple Present is used.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    When you will arrive tonight, we will go out for dinner. <font color='Red'><b>Not Correct</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    When you arrive tonight, we will go out for dinner. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br /><b>8. Position of Adverbs</b><br /><br />The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You will never help him.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Will you ever help him?</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You are never going to meet Jane.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Are you ever going to meet Jane?</font><br /><br /><b>9.
