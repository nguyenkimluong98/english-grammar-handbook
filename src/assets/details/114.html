<b>Used To</b><br /><br /><b>Structure</b><br /><br />used to + VERB<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I used to go to the beach every day.</font><br /><br />It is better not to use "used to" in questions or negative forms; however, this is sometimes done in informal spoken English. It is better to ask questions and create negative sentences using Simple Past.<br /><br /><b>1. Habit in the Past</b><br /><br />"Used to" expresses the idea that something was an old habit that stopped in the past. It indicates that something was often repeated in the past, but it is not usually done now.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Jerry used to study English.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Sam and Mary used to go to Mexico in the summer.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I used to start work at 9 o'clock.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Christine used to eat meat, but now she is a vegetarian.</font><br /><br /><b>2. Past Facts and Generalizations</b><br /><br />"Used to" can also be used to talk about past facts or generalizations which are no longer true.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I used to live in Paris.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Sarah used to be fat, but now she is thin.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    George used to be the best student in class, but now Lena is the best.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Oranges used to cost very little in Florida, but now they are quite expensive.</font><br /><br /><b>3. "Used to" vs. Simple Past</b><br /><br />Both Simple Past and "Used to" can be used to describe past habits, past facts and past generalizations; however, "used to" is preferred when emphasizing these forms of past repetition in positive sentences. On the other hand, when asking questions or making negative sentences, Simple Past is preferred.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You used to play the piano.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Did you play the piano when you were young?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You did not play the piano when you were young.</font><br /><br /><b>4.
