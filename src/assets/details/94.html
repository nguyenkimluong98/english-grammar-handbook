<b>Phrasal Verbs</b><br /><br /><b>1.  A phrasal verb is a verb plus a preposition or adverb which creates a meaning different from the original verb.</b><br />Example:<br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>I ran into my teacher at the movies last night. <font color='Black'><i>RUN + INTO = MEET</i></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>He ran away when he was 15. <font color='Black'><i>RUN + AWAY = LEAVE HOME</i></font></font><br /><br /><b>2. Some phrasal verbs are intransitive. An intransitive verb cannot be followed by an object.</b><br />Example:<br />He suddenly showed up. <font color='Black'><i>"SHOW UP" CANNOT TAKE AN OBJECT</i></font><br /><br /><b>3.
