<b>A. Future Real Conditional</b><br /><br><b>Structure:</b><br /><br /><b><i>If / When ... Simple Present ..., ... Simple Future ...<br /><br />... Simple Future ... if / when ... Simple Present ...</i></b><br /><br />Notice that there is no future in the if- or when-clause.<br />

<br>The future real conditional is used to describe plans and realistic goals as well as possible outcomes. It allows you to say that there is a plan, but you are considering possible limiting factors. You could also use it to mention requirements or steps.<br>

<b>If / When</b><br /><br />Both "if" and "when" are used in the Future Real Conditional, but the use is different from other Real Conditional forms. In the Future Real Conditional, "if" suggests that you do not know if something will happen or not. "When" suggests that something will definitely happen at some point; we are simply waiting for it to occur. Notice also that the Simple Future is not used in if-clauses or when-clauses.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    When you call me, I will give you the address.</font><br /><i>    YOU ARE GOING TO CALL ME LATER, AND AT THAT TIME, I WILL GIVE YOU THE ADDRESS.</i><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If you call me, I will give you the address.</font><br /><i>    IF YOU WANT THE ADDRESS, YOU CAN CALL ME.</i>
