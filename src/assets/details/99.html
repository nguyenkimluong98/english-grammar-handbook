<b>Present Perfect Continuous</b><br /><br />
The present perfect continuous refers to an unspecified time between 'before now' and 'now'. The speaker is thinking about something that started but perhaps did not finish in that period of time. He/she is interested in the process as well as the result, and this process may still be going on, or may have just finished.<br /><br />

Duration from the Past Until Now</b><br /><br />We use the Present Perfect Continuous to show that something started in the past and has continued up until now. "For five minutes," "for two weeks," and "since Tuesday" are all durations which can be used with the Present Perfect Continuous.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br />
<br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I've been wanting to do that for ten years.</font>
<br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He's been working here since 2001.</font>
<br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    They have been talking for the last hour.</font>
<br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She has been working at that company for three years.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    What have you been doing for the last 30 minutes?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    James has been teaching at the university since June.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    We have been waiting here for over two hours!</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Why has Nancy not been taking her medicine for the last three days?</font><br /><br /><b>2. Recently, Lately</b><br /><br />You can also use the Present Perfect Continuous WITHOUT a duration such as "for two weeks." Without the duration, the tense has a more general meaning of "lately." We often use the words "lately" or "recently" to emphasize this meaning.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Recently, I have been feeling really tired.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She has been watching too much television lately.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Have you been exercising lately?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Mary has been feeling a little depressed.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Lisa has not been practicing her English.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    What have you been doing?</font><br /><br />Remember that the Present Perfect Continuous has the meaning of "lately" or "recently." If you use the Present Perfect Continuous in a question such as "Have you been feeling alright?", it can suggest that the person looks sick or unhealthy. A question such as "Have you been smoking?" can suggest that you smell the smoke on the person. Using this tense in a question suggests you can see, smell, hear or feel the results of the action. It is possible to insult someone by using this tense incorrectly.<br /><br /><b>3. Non-Continuous Verbs/ Mixed Verbs</b><br /><br />It is important to remember that Non-Continuous Verbs cannot be used in any continuous tenses. Also, certain non-continuous meanings for Mixed Verbs cannot be used in continuous tenses. Instead of using Present Perfect Continuous with these verbs, you must use Present Perfect.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Sam has been having his car for two years. <font color='Red'><b>Not Correct</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Sam has had his car for two years. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br /><b>4.
