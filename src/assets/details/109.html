<b>Subjunctive</b><br /><br />Subjunctive is rather insignificant in modern English. Most likely you might come across this form in American English, and most probably in formal texts.<br /><br /><b>Structure</b><br /><br />Use the simple form of the verb. The simple form is the infinitive without the "to." The simple form of the verb "to go" is "go." The Subjunctive is only noticeable in certain forms and tenses.<br /><br />The Subjunctive is used to emphasize urgency or importance. It is used after certain expressions (see below).<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I suggest that he study.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Is it essential that we be there?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Don recommended that you join the committee.</font><br /><br /><b>NOTICE</b><br /><br />The Subjunctive is only noticeable in certain forms and tenses.
