<h1>Interjections</h1>
Interjections are small words that bear no grammatical connection with the sentences in which they are used. They express the emotions or sentiments of the speaker or convey hesitation or protest. They are usually followed by an exclamation mark.
<br><br>
Since many interjections are mainly written forms of actual sounds that were produced by humans, they are hardly used in academic or scholarly writing, unless they are a part of a direct quote or otherwise.
<br><br>
<b>Ah!</b> Now that's what I call a good shot! <b>Bravo!</b>
<br><br>
Both <b>Ah</b> and <b>Bravo</b> are interjections used to show the speaker's admiration in the sentence. There are many different uses for various interjections; the following is a list of the common interjections you may hear around you in daily life -
