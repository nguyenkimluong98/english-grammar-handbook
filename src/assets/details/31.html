<b>Future in the Past</b><br /><br />Like Simple Future, Future in the Past has two different forms in English: "would" and "was going to." Although the two forms can sometimes be used interchangeably, they often express two different meanings.<br /><br /><b>1. Would</b><br /><br />would + VERB<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />

Future in Past</b><br /><br />Future in the Past is used to express the idea that in the past you thought something would happen in the future. It does not matter if you are correct or not. Future in the Past follows the same basic rules as the Simple Future. "Would" is used to volunteer or promise, and "was going to" is used to plan. Moreover, both forms can be used to make predictions about the future.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I told you he was going to come to the party. plan</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I knew Julie would make dinner. voluntary action</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Jane said Sam was going to bring his sister with him, but he came alone. plan</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I had a feeling that the vacation was going to be a disaster. prediction</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He promised he would send a postcard from Egypt. promise</font><br /><br /><b>4. No Future in Time Clauses</b><br /><br />Like all future forms, Future in the Past cannot be used in clauses beginning with time expressions such as: when, while, before, after, by the time, as soon as, if, unless, etc. Instead of using Future in the Past, you must use Simple Past.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I already told Mark that when he would arrive, we would go out for dinner. <font color='Red'><b>Not Correct</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I already told Mark that when he arrived, we would go out for dinner. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br /><b>5.
