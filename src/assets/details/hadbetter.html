<b>Had Better</b>
<br />
<p>We use <b>had better</b> to refer to the present or the future, to talk about actions we think people should do or which are desirable in a specific situation. The verb form is always had, not have. We normally shorten it to <b>'d better</b> in informal situations. It is followed by the infinitive without to.</p>

	    <font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;She'd better get here soon or she'll miss the opening ceremony.</font><br />
        <font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;You'd  better tell her everything.</font><br />
        <font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;I'd  better get back to work.</font><br />
        <font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;We'd  better meet early.</font><br />
      
    </div>
    <p>The  negative form is <b>&ldquo;had better not&rdquo;</b>.</p>
    <div>
      
        <font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;You'd  better not say anything.</font><br />
        <font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;I'd  better not come.</font><br />
        <font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;We'd  better not miss the start of his presentation.</font><br />
      
    </div>
    <p>We use <b>&ldquo;had  better&rdquo;</b> to give advice about specific situations, not general ones. If you want  to talk about general situations, you must use <b>&ldquo;should&rdquo;</b>.</p>
    <div>
      
        <font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;You  should brush your teeth before you go to bed.</font><br />
        <font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;I  shouldn't listen to negative people.</font><br />
        <font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;He  should dress more appropriately for the office.</font><br />
      
    </div>
    <p>When we  give advice about specific situations, it is also possible to use <b>&ldquo;should&rdquo;.</b> </p>
    <div>
      
        <font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;You  shouldn't say anything.</font><br />
        <font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;I  should get back to work.</font><br />
        <font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;We should  meet early.</font><br />
      
    </div>
    <p>However,  when we use <b>&ldquo;had better&rdquo;</b> there is a suggestion that if the advice is not  followed, that something bad will happen. </p>
    <div>
      
        <font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;You'd  better do what I say or else you will get into trouble.</font><br />
        <font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;I'd  better get back to work or my boss will be angry with me.</font><br />
        <font color='blue'>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;We'd  better get to the airport by five or else we may miss the flight.</font><br />
