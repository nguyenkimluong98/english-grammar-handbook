<b>Past Perfect Continuous</b><br /><br />
The past perfect continuous corresponds to the present perfect continuous, but with reference to a time earlier than 'before now'. As with the present perfect continuous, we are more interested in the process.<br />
The past perfect continuous is composed of two elements - the past perfect of the verb to be (=had been) + the present participle (base+ing).

<br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>     She had been playing chess since 7 O'clock.</font>
<br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You had been waiting there for more than two hours when she finally arrived.</font>
<br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Had you been waiting there for more than two hours when she finally arrived?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You had not been waiting there for more than two hours when she finally arrived.</font><br /><br /><b>1. Duration Before Something in the Past</b><br /><br />We use the Past Perfect Continuous to show that something started in the past and continued up until another time in the past. "For five minutes" and "for two weeks" are both durations which can be used with the Past Perfect Continuous. Notice that this is related to the Present Perfect Continuous; however, the duration does not continue until now, it stops before something else in the past.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    They had been talking for over an hour before Tony arrived.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She had been working at that company for three years when it went out of business.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    How long had you been waiting to get on the bus?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Mike wanted to sit down because he had been standing all day at work.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    James had been teaching at the university for more than a year before he left for Asia.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    A: How long had you been studying Turkish before you moved to Ankara?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    B: I had not been studying Turkish very long.</font><br /><br /><b>2. Cause of Something in the Past</b><br /><br />Using the Past Perfect Continuous before another action in the past is a good way to show cause and effect.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Jason was tired because he had been jogging.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Sam gained weight because he had been overeating.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Betty failed the final test because she had not been attending class.</font><br /><br /><b>3. Past Continuous vs. Past Perfect Continuous</b><br /><br />If you do not include a duration such as "for five minutes," "for two weeks" or "since Friday," many English speakers choose to use the Past Continuous rather than the Past Perfect Continuous. Be careful because this can change the meaning of the sentence. Past Continuous emphasizes interrupted actions, whereas Past Perfect Continuous emphasizes a duration of time before something in the past. Study the examples below to understand the difference.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He was tired because he was exercising so hard.</font><br /><i>    THIS SENTENCE EMPHASIZES THAT HE WAS TIRED BECAUSE HE WAS EXERCISING AT THAT EXACT MOMENT.</i><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He was tired because he had been exercising so hard.</font><br /><i>    THIS SENTENCE EMPHASIZES THAT HE WAS TIRED BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN EXERCISING OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HE WAS STILL EXERCISING AT THAT MOMENT OR THAT HE HAD JUST FINISHED.</i><br /><br /><b>4. Non-Continuous Verbs / Mixed Verbs</b><br /><br />It is important to remember that Non-Continuous Verbs cannot be used in any continuous tenses. Also, certain non-continuous meanings for Mixed Verbs cannot be used in continuous tenses. Instead of using Past Perfect Continuous with these verbs, you must use Past Perfect.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The motorcycle had been belonging to George for years before Tina bought it. <font color='Red'><b>Not Correct</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The motorcycle had belonged to George for years before Tina bought it. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br /><b>5.
