<b>Also / Too / Either</b><br>
<p>Here  is an explanation of the use of also, too, and either which can cause  some confusion as to their functions and position in a sentence.</p>
<h3 class="orange">Also</h3>
<p>Also  is used in positive sentences to add something which agrees with the previous  item/clause.<br />   <i>Marco  speaks Italian. Peter also speaks Italian.<br />   I  love Japanese food and I also like Indian cuisine.<br />   Sarah  is also coming to the station to see James off.</i></p>
<p>Also  is placed before the main verb in a clause or sentence except with the verb  be.<br />   <i>I  have also seen that film.<br />   I  am also living in London at the moment.<br />   Marco  speaks Italian. Peter can also speak Italian.<br />   Danny  is really tired and I am also exhausted.<br /> We  were also at the concert.</i></p>
<h3 class="orange">Too</h3>
<p>Too  usually comes at the end of a sentence or clause.<br />   <i>I  have seen the film too.<br />   I  am living in London too.<br />   Peter  can speak Italian too.<br />   Danny  is really tired and I am tired too.<br />   We  were at the concert too.</i></p>
<p>Too  can sometimes be used with commas after the subject of the sentence although  this is usually only done in formal speech;<br />   <i>I,  too, am tired of the incessant noise coming from the restaurants in the area.<br /> Mr  Rossi is pleased with the project. Mr Martin, too, expressed his satisfaction.</i></p>
<h3 class="orange">Either</h3>
<p>Either  is used in negative sentences to add an agreeing idea or thought.<br />   <i>I  don't speak French and Sarah doesn't speak French either.<br />   Peter  is busy tonight and Danny can't come either.<br />   So  you didn't go to the concert. Well, we didn&rsquo;t either. Was it good?</i></p>
<p>Either  usually comes at the end of a sentence or clause.<br />   <i>I  don't like sushi either.<br />   I  am not studying accounts either.<br /> I  am not coming either.</i></p>
<p>Look  at these examples:<br />   <i>The  weather was not at all nice. I also had to do some studying so I stayed in.<br />   The  flight wasn't expensive and Sarah wanted to be in London for the concert too.</i></p>
<p>And</p>
<p><i>Peter  is too impatient to be in customer relations and he isn't good with people  either.<br />   Tess  is lazy. She doesn't want to study either.</i></p>
<p>It  is possible to have a positive sentence or clause and agree with a negative or  have a negative sentence or clause and agree with it with a positive.</p>
