<b>B. Future Unreal Conditional</b><br /><br><b>1. Structure 1 (Most Commonly Used)</b><br /><br /><b><i>If ... Simple Past ..., ... would + verb ...<br /><br />... would + verb ... if ... Simple Past ...</i></b><br /><br />The Future Unreal Conditional is used to talk about imaginary situations in the future. It is not as commonly used as the Future Real Conditional because native speakers often leave open the possibility that anything 'might' happen. <br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I had some time off work, I would go to Paris.</font><br /><i>    BUT I DON'T.</i><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I'm really busy next week. If I had time, I would meet you.</font><br /><i>    I do not have time to meet you.</i><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Peter would help me tomorrow if he didn't have to work.</font><br /><i>    He has to work tomorrow.</i><br /><br /><b>2. Structure 2</b><br /><br /><b><i>If ... were + present participle ..., ... would be + present participle ...<br /><br />... would be + present participle ... if ... were + present participle ...</i></b><br /><br />Structure 2 of the Future Unreal Conditional is also used to talk about imaginary situations in the future.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I were going to Paris next week, I would be trying to find accommodation.</font><br /><i>    I am not going to Paris and I am not trying to find accommodation.</i><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I were not working tomorrow, I would help you. (Note that the 'were + present participle' structure is now in the 'if clause'.</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I had time tomorrow, I would be fishing on the lake. ( 'were + present participle' structure is in the result clause)</font><br /><br /><b>3. Structure 3</b><br /><br /><b><i>If ... were going to + verb ..., ... would be + present participle ...<br /><br />... would be + present participle ... if ... were going to + verb ...</i></b><br /><br />Structure 3 of the Future Unreal Conditional is a variation of Structure 2 which is also used to talk about imaginary situations in the future.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I were going to go to Rome, I would be trying to find accommodation.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I were not going to visit my grandmother tomorrow, I would help you study.</font><br /><br /><b>4. Only use "If"</b><br /><br />Only the word "if" is used with the Past Unreal Conditional because you are discussing imaginary situations. "When" cannot be used.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I would buy that car tomorrow when it were cheaper. <font color='Red'><b>Wrong</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I would buy that car tomorrow if it were cheaper. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br /><b>5. Conditional with Modal Verbs</b><br /><br />There are some special conditional forms for modal verbs in English:<br /><br />would + can = could<br /><br />would + shall = should<br /><br />would + may = might<br /><br />The words "can," "shall" and "may" cannot be used with "would." Instead, they must be used in these special forms.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I went to UK next year, I would can learn English. Unfortunately, that's not possible. <font color='Red'><b>Wrong</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I went to UK next year, I could learn English. Unfortunately, that's not possible. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br />The words "could," should," "might" and "ought to" include conditional, so you cannot combine them with "would."<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I didn't have to work tonight, I would could go to the fitness center. <font color='Red'><b>Wrong</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I didn't have to work tonight, I could go to the fitness center. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br /><b>6.
