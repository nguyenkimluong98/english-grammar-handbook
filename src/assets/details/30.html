<b>Future Continuous (Future Progressive)</b><br /><br />
The future continuous refers to an unfinished action or event that will be in progress at a time later than now. The future continuous is used for quite a few different purposes.
<br />
The future continuous can be used to project ourselves into the future.
<br /><br />
Future Continuous has two different forms: "will be doing " and "be going to be doing." Unlike Simple Future forms, Future Continuous forms are usually interchangeable.<br /><br />
<b>1. Future Continuous with "Will"</b><br /><br />will be + present participle<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    This time tomorrow we'll be sitting on the beach. I can't wait!</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Don't ring at 8 o'clock. I'll be watching Who Wants to be a Millionaire.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You will be waiting for her when her plane arrives tonight.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Will you be waiting for her when her plane arrives tonight?</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You will not be waiting for her when her plane arrives tonight.</font><br /><br /><b>2. Future Continuous with "Be Going To "</b><br /><br />am/is/are + going to be + present participle<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You are going to be waiting for her when her plane arrives tonight.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Are you going to be waiting for her when her plane arrives tonight?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You are not going to be waiting for her when her plane arrives tonight.</font><br /><br /><i>It is possible to use either "will" or "be going to" to create the Future Continuous with little difference in meaning.</i><br /><br /><b>3. Interrupted Action in the Future</b><br /><br />Use the Future Continuous to indicate that a longer action in the future will be interrupted by a shorter action in the future. Remember this can be a real interruption or just an interruption in time.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I will be watching TV when she arrives tonight.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I will be waiting for you when your bus arrives.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I am going to be staying at the Madison Hotel, if anything happens and you need to contact me.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He will be studying at the library tonight, so he will not see Jennifer when she arrives.</font><br /><br />Notice in the examples above that the interruptions (marked in italics) are in Simple Present rather than Simple Future. This is because the interruptions are in time clauses, and you cannot use future tenses in time clauses.<br /><br /><b>3. Specific Time as an Interruption in the Future</b><br /><br />In the first use, described above, the Future Continuous is interrupted by a short action in the future. In addition to using short actions as interruptions, you can also use a specific time as an interruption.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Tonight at 6 PM, I am going to be eating dinner.</font><br /><i>    I WILL BE IN THE PROCESS OF EATING DINNER.</i><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    At midnight tonight, we will still be driving through the desert.</font><br /><i>    WE WILL BE IN THE PROCESS OF DRIVING THROUGH THE DESERT.</i><br /><br /><b><i>In the Simple Future, a specific time is used to show the time an action will begin or end. In the Future Continuous, a specific time interrupts the action.</i></b><br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Tonight at 6 PM, I am going to eat dinner.</font><br /><i>    I AM GOING TO START EATING AT 6 PM.</i><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Tonight at 6 PM, I am going to be eating dinner.</font><br /><i>    I AM GOING TO START EARLIER AND I WILL BE IN THE PROCESS OF EATING DINNER AT 6 PM.</i><br /><br /><b>4. Parallel Actions in the Future</b><br /><br />When you use the Future Continuous with two actions in the same sentence, it expresses the idea that both actions will be happening at the same time. The actions are parallel.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I am going to be studying and he is going to be making dinner.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Tonight, they will be eating dinner, discussing their plans, and having a good time.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    While Ellen is reading, Tim will be watching television.</font><br /><i>    NOTICE "IS READING" BECAUSE OF THE TIME CLAUSE CONTAINING "WHILE." (SEE EXPLANATION BELOW)</i><br /><br /><b><i>Atmosphere in the Future</i></b><br /><br />In English, we often use a series of Parallel Actions to describe atmosphere at a specific point in the future.<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    When I arrive at the party, everybody is going to be celebrating. Some will be dancing. Others are going to be talking. A few people will be eating pizza, and several people are going to be drinking beer. They always do the same thing.</font><br /><br /><b>5. No Future in Time Clauses</b><br /><br />Like all future tenses, the Future Continuous cannot be used in clauses beginning with time expressions such as: when, while, before, after, by the time, as soon as, if, unless, etc. Instead of Future Continuous, Present Continuous is used.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    While I am going to be finishing my homework, she is going to make dinner. <font color='Red'><b>Not Correct</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    While I am finishing my homework, she is going to make dinner. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br /><b>6. Non-Continuous Verbs / Mixed Verbs</b><br /><br />It is important to remember that Non-Continuous Verbs cannot be used in any continuous tenses. Also, certain non-continuous meanings for Mixed Verbs cannot be used in continuous tenses. Instead of using Future Continuous with these verbs, you must use Simple Future.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Jane will be being at my house when you arrive. <font color='Red'><b>Not Correct</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Jane will be at my house when you arrive. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br /><b>7. Position of Adverbs</b><br /><br />The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You will still be waiting for her when her plane arrives.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Will you still be waiting for her when her plane arrives?</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You are still going to be waiting for her when her plane arrives.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Are you still going to be waiting for her when her plane arrives?</font><br /><br /><b>8. Active / Passive</b><br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    At 8:00 PM tonight, John will be washing the dishes. Active</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    At 8:00 PM tonight, the dishes will be being washed by John. Passive</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    At 8:00 PM tonight, John is going to be washing the dishes. Active</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    At 8:00 PM tonight, the dishes are going to be being washed by John. Passive</font><br /><br />NOTE: Passive forms of the Future Continuous are not common.<br />
