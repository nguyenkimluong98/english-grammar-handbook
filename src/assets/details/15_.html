<b>A. Past Real Conditional</b><br /><br><b>Structure:</b><br /><br /><b><i>If / When ... Simple Past ..., ... Simple Past ...<br /><br />... Simple Past... if / when ... Simple Past ...</i></b><br /><br />The Past Real Conditional describes what you used to do in particular real-life situations. It suggests that your habits have changed and you do not usually do these things today.<br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    When I had a day off from work, I often went to the beach.

Now, she usually drives.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Jerry always helped me with my homework when he had time. But he doesn't do that anymore.</font><br /><br /><b>1. Used to</b><br /><br />We use 'used to' for something that happened regularly in the past but no longer happens. This form is commonly used in Past Real Conditional sentences to emphasize that something was a habit.<br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I went to a friend's house for dinner, I used to take a bottle of wine or some flowers. I don't do that anymore.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    When I had a day off from work, I used to go to the beach. Now, I never get time off.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If the weather was nice, she used to walk to work. Now, she usually drives.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Jerry used to help me with my homework when he had time.

If / When</b><br /><br />Both "if" and "when" are used in the Past Real Conditional. Using "if" suggests that something happened less frequently. Using "when" suggests that something happened regularly.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    When I had a day off from work, I usually went to the beach.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I regularly had days off from work.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If I had a day off from work, I usually went to the beach.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I rarely had days off from work.</font>
