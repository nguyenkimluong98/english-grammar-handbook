<b>Future Perfect Continuous</b><br /><br />
Like the future perfect simple, this form is used to project ourselves forward in time and to look back. It refers to events or actions in a time between now and some future time are unfinished. It is most often used with a time expression.
<br /><br />
Future Perfect Continuous has two different forms: "will have been doing " and "be going to have been doing." Unlike Simple Future forms, Future Perfect Continuous forms are usually interchangeable.<br /><br /><b>1. Future Perfect Continuous with "Will"</b><br /><br />will have been + present participle<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    When I come at 6:00, will you have been practicing long?</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Next year I will have been working here for four years.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    When I finish this course, I will have been learning English for twenty years.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You will have been waiting for more than two hours when her plane finally arrives.</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Will you have been waiting for more than two hours when her plane finally arrives?</font><br />
&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You will not have been waiting for more than two hours when her plane finally arrives.</font><br /><br /><b>2. Future Perfect Continuous with "Be Going To"</b><br /><br />am/is/are + going to have been + present participle<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You are going to have been waiting for more than two hours when her plane finally arrives.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Are you going to have been waiting for more than two hours when her plane finally arrives?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You are not going to have been waiting for more than two hours when her plane finally arrives.</font><br /><br /><b><i>It is possible to use either "will" or "be going to" to create the Future Perfect Continuous with little or no difference in meaning.</i></b><br /><br /><b>3. Duration Before Something in the Future</b><br /><br />We use the Future Perfect Continuous to show that something will continue up until a particular event or time in the future. "For five minutes," "for two weeks," and "since Friday" are all durations which can be used with the Future Perfect Continuous. Notice that this is related to the Present Perfect Continuous and the Past Perfect Continuous; however, with Future Perfect Continuous, the duration stops at or before a reference point in the future.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    They will have been talking for over an hour by the time Thomas arrives.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    She is going to have been working at that company for three years when it finally closes.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    James will have been teaching at the university for more than a year by the time he leaves for Asia.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    How long will you have been studying when you graduate?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    We are going to have been driving for over three days straight when we get to Anchorage.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    A: When you finish your English course, will you have been living in New Zealand for over a year?</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    B: No, I will not have been living here that long.</font><br /><br />Notice in the examples above that the reference points (marked in italics) are in Simple Present rather than Simple Future. This is because these future events are in time clauses, and you cannot use future tenses in time clauses.<br /><br /><b>4. Cause of Something in the Future</b><br /><br />Using the Future Perfect Continuous before another action in the future is a good way to show cause and effect.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Jason will be tired when he gets home because he will have been jogging for over an hour.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Claudia's English will be perfect when she returns to Germany because she is going to have been studying English in the United States for over two years.</font><br /><br /><b>5. Future Continuous vs. Future Perfect Continuous</b><br /><br />If you do not include a duration such as "for five minutes," "for two weeks" or "since Friday," many English speakers choose to use the Future Continuous rather than the Future Perfect Continuous. Be careful because this can change the meaning of the sentence. Future Continuous emphasizes interrupted actions, whereas Future Perfect Continuous emphasizes a duration of time before something in the future. Study the examples below to understand the difference.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He will be tired because he will be exercising so hard.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    This sentence emphasizes that he will be tired because he will be exercising at that exact moment in the future.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He will be tired because he will have been exercising so hard.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    This sentence emphasizes that he will be tired because he will have been exercising for a period of time. It is possible that he will still be exercising at that moment OR that he will just have finished.</font><br /><br /><b>6. No Future in Time Clauses</b><br /><br />Like all future forms, the Future Perfect Continuous cannot be used in clauses beginning with time expressions such as: when, while, before, after, by the time, as soon as, if, unless, etc. Instead of Future Perfect Continuous, Present Perfect Continuous is used.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You won't get a promotion until you will have been working here as long as Tim. <font color='Red'><b>Not Correct</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You won't get a promotion until you have been working here as long as Tim. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br /><b>7. Non-Continuous Verbs / Mixed Verbs</b><br /><br />It is important to remember that Non-Continuous Verbs cannot be used in any continuous tenses. Also, certain non-continuous meanings for Mixed Verbs cannot be used in continuous tenses. Instead of using Future Perfect Continuous with these verbs, you must use Future Perfect .<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Ned will have been having his driver's license for over two years. <font color='Red'><b>Not Correct</b></font></font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Ned will have had his driver's license for over two years. <font color='Green'><b>Correct</b></font></font><br /><br /><b>8. Position of Adverbs</b><br /><br />The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You will only have been waiting for a few minutes when her plane arrives.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Will you only have been waiting for a few minutes when her plane arrives?</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    You are only going to have been waiting for a few minutes when her plane arrives.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Are you only going to have been waiting for a few minutes when her plane arrives?</font><br /><br /><b>9. Active / Passive</b><br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The famous artist will have been painting the mural for over six months by the time it is finished.
