<b>Also / Too / Either</b><br /><br />The following is a mini-tutorial on the use of the words "also," "too" and "either." After you have studied the tutorial, complete the associated exercises. If you already know how to use these words, you can skip the explanation and go directly to the exercises.<br />Also<br /><b>USE</b><br /><br />"Also" is used in positive sentences to add an agreeing thought.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Jane speaks French. Sam also speaks French.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I love chocolate. I also love pizza.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Frank can come with us. Nancy can also come with us.</font><br /><br /><b>PLACEMENT</b><br /><br />"Also" comes after "to be."<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I am also Canadian.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I was also there.</font><br /><br />With verbs other than "to be," "also" comes before single verb forms.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I also sing.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He also helped us.</font><br /><br />In verb tenses with many parts, "also" comes after the first part and before the second.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I have also been to Hong Kong.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I am also studying economics.</font><br /><br />Similarly, since modal verbs are usually followed by a second verb, "also" comes after modal verbs.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I can also speak French.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I should also be there.</font><br /><br /><b>Too</b><br /><b>USE</b><br /><br />"Too" is used in positive sentences to add an agreeing thought. It has the same meaning as "also," but its placement within the sentence is different.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Jane speaks French. Sam speaks French too.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I love chocolate. I love pizza too.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Frank can come with us. Nancy can come with us too.</font><br /><br /><b>PLACEMENT</b><br /><br />"Too" usually comes at the end of a clause.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I am Canadian too.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I can speak French too.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I am studying economics too.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    If he wants to go too, he should meet us at 8:00.</font><br /><br /><b>IMPORTANT</b><br /><br />Although "too" is usually placed at the end of a clause, it can sometimes be used with commas after the subject of the sentence. This is usually only done in formal speech.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Mr. Jones wanted the contract. Ms. Jackson, too, thought it was necessary.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Donna is working on a solution to the problem. I, too, am trying to find a way to resolve the conflict.</font><br /><br /><b>Either</b><br /><b>USE</b><br /><br />"Either" is used in negative sentences to add an agreeing thought.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Jane doesn't speak French. Sam doesn't speak French either.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I don't love chocolate. I don't love pizza either.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Frank cannot come with us. Nancy cannot come with us either.</font><br /><br /><b>PLACEMENT</b><br /><br />"Either" usually comes at the end of a clause.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I cannot speak French either.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I am not studying economics either.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I don't want to eat either.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    I didn't like the movie either.</font><br /><br /><b>Confusing Sentences</b><br /><br />Sometimes the first sentence is negative and the agreeing idea is positive.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The weather wasn't very appealing. I also wanted to stay home and finish my book. That's why I didn't go to the beach.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    The car wasn't expensive, and I needed a way to get around town too. That's why I bought it.</font><br /><br />Sometimes the first sentence is positive and the agreeing idea is negative.<br /><br /><font color='#126069'>Examples:</font><br /><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    Jane is too short. She is not a good athlete either. I don't think she would make a good basketball player.</font><br />&nbsp;&bull;<font color='blue'>    He is lazy. He doesn't study either.
